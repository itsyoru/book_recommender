مغامرة العقل الأولى,فراس السواح,الأسطورة حكاية مقدسة تقليدية، بمعنى أنها انتقلت من جيل إلى جيل، بالرواية الشفهية. مما يجعلها ذاكرة الجماعة التي تحفظ قيمها وعاداتها وطقوسها وحكمتها، وتنقلها للأجيال المتعاقبة، وتكسبها القوة المسيطرة على النفوس. فهي الأداة الأقوى في التثقيف والتطبيع والقناة التي ترسخ من خلالها ثقافة ما وجودها واستمرارها عبر الأجيال وحتى في فترات شيوع الكتابة، لم تفقد الأسطورة الشفهية قوتها وتأثيرها. ذلك أن الألواح الفخارية، كانت محفوظة في المعابد وفي مكتبات الملوك، ولا تلعب إلا دور الحافظ للأسطورة من التحريف بالتناقل. وبقي السمع هو الوسيلة الرئيسية في تداولها. وفي أكثر من مناسبة دورية، كانت الأساطير تتلى أو تنشد في الاحتفالات الدينية العامة، من ذلك مثلاً، أعياد رأس السنة في بابل، حيث كانت تتلى وتمثل أسطورة التكوين البابلية. وأعياد الربيع حيث كانت تتلى وتمثل عذابات الاله تموز. بالإضافة إلى ذلك فإن الأسطورة هي أيضاً نص أدبي، وضع في أبهى حلة فنية ممكنة، واقوى صيغة مؤثرة في النفوس، وهذا ما زاد في سيطرتها وتأثيرها. وكان على الأدب والشعر، أن ينتظرا فترة طويلة، قبل أن ينفصلا عن الأسطورة. لقد وضعت معظم الأساطير السورية والسومرية والبابلية في أجمل شكل شعري ممكن. وقام هوميروس بصياغة معظم أساطير عصره المتداولة، شعراً في الأوديسة والإلياذة. وإلى جانب الشعر والأدب، خلقت الأسطورة فنوناً أخرى كالمسرح الذي ابتدأ عهده بتمثيل الأساطير الرئيسية في الأعياد الدينية. كما دفعت فنوناً أخرى كالغناء والموسيقى وغيرها. وبعد هذا كتاب في أسطورة الشرق القديم، وهو بين يد القارئ في طبعته الثالثة عشرة. وهدف الباحث من وراء كتابه هذا التعريف بالأسطورة في سوريا القديمة وبلاد الرافدين، معتمداً في ذلك على النصوص الكاملة لأهم الأساطير المعروفة والتي تم استحضارها من خلال أكثر من نص وأكثر من ترجمة. وقد كانت براعة الباحث في تقديم كل أسطورة في مناخها العام من الأساطير واضحة حيث أخذت كل أسطورة في هذه الدراسة مكانها في صورة الأساطير ككل، مستمدة تفسيرها من البنية الإجمالية للدراسة. وكان منهجه في تقديم الأساطير يعتمد على جمعها من مجموعات وفق موضوعاتها لا وفق تسلسل زمني أو توزع جغرافي، لأن تفسير أسطورة ما، يبدو عصياً، إذا لم ينظر إليها من خلال منظور شامل، يجمعها مع غيرها من الأساطير التي تعالج نفس الموضوع. وهو منهج جديد في دراسة أساطير المنطقة. بالإضافة إلى ذلك قام الباحث ومن خلال أسفار الكتاب، بمقارنة شاملة مع كتاب التوراة العبرانية، فيما يتعلق بالنصوص الأسطورية الواردة فيه، وذلك لإظهار، مدى اعتماد الثقافة اليهودية على الثقافة السورية والبابلية في صياغة أهم مرجع ديني وثقافي لدى الشعب اليهودي، مظهراً علاقة الأساطير السورية والبابلية بأساطير الشعوب المجاورة كالمصريين والإغريق، متتبعاً ما أمكنه ذلك الأصول الشرقية للأساطير الإغريقية. أما لماذا اقتصر بحثه على سورية وبلاد الرافدين دون بغية ثقافات الشرق القديم، فيوضح الباحث بأن ذلك راجع لأسباب ثلاثة: الأول هو الوحدة الثقافية القائمة في هذا الجزء من المنطقة، هذه الوحدة الثقافية القائمة في هذا الجزء من المنطقة، هذه الوحدة هي التي تعطي لأي بحث يدور حولهما طابع الانسجام والتكامل. والثاني راجع لاتساع الموضوع وتشعبه، مما لا يسمح بدراسة وافية لميثولوجيا الشرق القديم في كتاب واحد ومن قبل مؤلف واحد. أما السبب الثالث فهو يرجع إلى ميل الباحث إلى آداب هذه المنطقة، وولعه بتاريخها وتراثها. وإلى ذلك كان توجه الباحث من خلال كتابه هذا لم يكن إلى زمرة معينة من القراء، بل توجهه كان إلى زمر متعددة فالقارئ العادي يجد فيه موضوعاً جديداً على الكتابات العربية الحديثة، لأنه أول كتاب يعالج موضوع الأسطورة على هذا المستوى من الإحاطة. وسيجد القارئ المطلع كثيراً من المعلومات الجديدة والتفسيرات الجديدة. كما سيجد المهتمون بالديانات المقارنة عدداً لا بأس به من النقاط القابلة للدراسة والمناقشة، وكذلك الأمر فيما يتعلق بدارسي الآداب والديانة اليهودية. أما بالنسبة للمتخصصين، فيأمل الباحث أن تفتح النظرات والأفكار الجديدة التي طرحها في ثنايا هذا الكتاب، مجالاً لحوارات مجدية.,"['Mythology', 'Religion', 'History', 'Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Anthropology', 'Humanities']",4.19,2348

L'Écume des jours,Boris Vian,"Chick, Alise, Chloé et Colin passent leur temps à dire des choses rigolotes, à écouter Duke Ellington et à patiner. Dans ce monde où les pianos sont des mélangeurs à cocktails, la réalité semble ne pas avoir de prise. On se marie à l'église comme on va à la fête foraine et on ignore le travail, qui se réduit à une usine monstrueuse faisant tache sur le paysage. Pied de nez aux conventions romanesques et à la morale commune, L'Écume des jours est un délice verbal et un festin poétique. Jeux de mots, néologismes, décalages incongrus... Vian surenchérit sans cesse, faisant naître comme un vertige chez le lecteur hébété, qui sourit quand il peut. Mais le véritable malaise vient d'ailleurs : ces adolescents éternels à la sensibilité exacerbée constituent des victimes de choix. L'obsession consumériste de Chick, née d'une idolâtrie frénétique pour un certain Jean-Sol Partre, semble vouloir dire que le bonheur ne saurait durer. En effet, l'asphyxie gagne du terrain, et l'on assiste avec effroi au rétrécissement inexorable des appartements. On en veut presque à Vian d'être aussi lucide et de ne pas s'être contenté d'une expérience ludique sur fond de roman d'amour. --Sana Tang-Léopold Wauters","['Fiction', 'France', 'Classics', 'French Literature', 'Romance', 'Novels', 'Roman', 'Fantasy', '20th Century', 'Literature']",3.99,26874

Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution,Pyotr Kropotkin,"In this cornerstone of modern liberal social theory, Peter Kropotkin states that the most effective human and animal communities are essentially cooperative, rather than competitive. Kropotkin based this classic on his observations of natural phenomena and history, forming a work of stunning and well-reasoned scholarship. Essential to the understanding of human evolution as well as social organization, it offers a powerful counterpoint to the tenets of Social Darwinism. It also cites persuasive evidence of human nature's innate compatibility with anarchist society.""Kropotkin's basic argument is correct,"" noted evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. ""Struggle does occur in many modes, and some lead to cooperation among members of a species as the best pathway to advantage for individuals."" Anthropologist Ashley Montagu declared that ""Mutual Aid will never be any more out of date than will the Declaration of Independence. New facts may increasingly become available, but we can already see that they will serve largely to support Kropotkin's conclusion that 'in the ethical progress of man, mutual support—not mutual struggle—has had the leading part.'"" Physician and author Alex Comfort asserted that ""Kropotkin profoundly influenced human biology by his theory of Mutual Aid. . . . He was one of the first systematic students of animal communities, and may be regarded as the founder of modern social ecology.""","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'History', 'Sociology', 'Theory', 'Economics', 'Politics', 'Classics', 'Anarchism', 'Political Science']",4.23,1993

Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth,Warsan Shire (Goodreads Author),"What elevates 'teaching my mother how to give birth', what gives the poems their disturbing brilliance, is Warsan Shire's ability to give simple, beautiful eloquence to the veiled world where sensuality lives in the dominant narrative of Islam; reclaiming the more nuanced truths of earlier times - as in Tayeb Salih's work - and translating to the realm of lyric the work of the likes of Nawal El Saadawi. As Rumi said, ""Love will find its way through all languages on its own"". In 'teaching my mother how to give birth', Warsan's debut pamphlet, we witness the unearthing of a poet who finds her way through all preconceptions to strike the heart directly. Warsan Shire is a Kenyan-born Somali poet and writer who is based in London. Born in 1988, she is an artist and activist who uses her work to document narratives of journey and trauma. Warsan has read her work internationally, including recent readings in South Africa, Italy and Germany, and her poetry has been translated into Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.","['Poetry', 'Feminism', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Womens', 'Adult', 'Race', 'Somalia', '21st Century', 'Contemporary']",4.3,14082
The Woman in Black,"Susan Hill, John Lawrence (Illustrator)","What real reader does not yearn, somewhere in the recesses of his or her heart, for a really literate, first-class thriller--one that chills the body, but warms the soul with plot, perception, and language at once astute and vivid? In other words, a ghost story written by Jane Austen?Alas, we cannot give you Austen, but Susan Hill's remarkable Woman In Black comes as close as our era can provide. Set on the obligatory English moor, on an isolated causeway, the story has as its hero Arthur Kipps, an up-and-coming young solicitor who has come north from London to attend the funeral and settle the affairs of Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House. The routine formalities he anticipates give way to a tumble of events and secrets more sinister and terrifying than any nightmare: the rocking chair in the deserted nursery, the eerie sound of a pony and trap, a child's scream in the fog, and most dreadfully--and for Kipps most tragically--The Woman In Black.The Woman In Black is both a brilliant exercise in atmosphere and controlled horror and a delicious spine-tingler--proof positive that this neglected genre, the ghost story, isn't dead after all.","['Horror', 'Fiction', 'Gothic', 'Classics', 'Mystery', 'Historical Fiction', 'Ghosts', 'Paranormal', 'Ghost Stories', 'Historical']",3.72,48032

Playful yet intense, sharply sarcastic yet deeply sincere, The Conqueror’s Shadow announces the appearance of a unique talent—and an antihero like no other.They called him the Terror of the East. His past shrouded in mystery, his identity hidden beneath a suit of enchanted black armor and a skull-like helm, Corvis Rebaine carved a bloody path through Imphallion, aided by Davro, a savage ogre, and Seilloah, a witch with a taste for human flesh. No shield or weapon could stop his demon-forged axe. And no magic could match the spells of his demon slave, Khanda.Yet just when ultimate victory was in his grasp, Rebaine faltered. His plans of conquest, born from a desire to see Imphallion governed with firmness and honesty, shattered. Amid the chaos of a collapsing army, Rebaine vanished, taking only a single hostage—the young noblewoman Tyannon—to guarantee his escape.Seventeen years later, Rebaine and Tyannon are married, living in obscurity and raising their children, a daughter and a son.

Until his daughter is assaulted by Audriss’s goons.Now, to rescue the country he once tried to conquer, Rebaine once more dons the armor of the Terror of the East and seeks out his former allies. But Davro has become a peaceful farmer. Seilloah has no wish to leave her haunted forest home. And Khanda . . . well, to describe his feelings for his former master as undying hatred would be an understatement.But even if Rebaine can convince his onetime comrades to join him, he faces a greater challenge: Does he dare to reawaken the part of him that gloried in cruelty, blood, and destruction?

Amish Forever - The Complete Series (Helping Hands Press Book 13),"Roger Rheinheimer (Goodreads Author), Crystal Linn (Goodreads Author)","Ava Troyer never really considered the possibility of life outside of the warm, protective Amish community. Even during her state-mandated schooling through the eighth grade, she would dreamily fantasize about whether any of the other Amish boys in the history class right after lunch was going to be the father of her children, or if she would meet the man of her dreams from another state, an exciting possibility. But the wreck that killed her father and almost killed Ava, that early Sunday morning, at the hands of an all-night reveler, changed everything.

His father was the only doctor for a small town of 1200, and had a hitching rail on a side street by his office for the Amish patients. His father bought an eighty acre farm, and Roger and his older brother worked it, raising cattle and growing crops. While he was still in high school, Roger learned woodworking skills from Elmer Schlabach, his Amish mentor. They built houses in the old-fashioned tradition, from hand-mixing the concrete for the foundations to hand-nailing the shingles. The only phase they did not do was the electrical. To this day, Roger enjoys using his wood crafting skills, making acoustic guitars and furniture. Roger earned an undergraduate degree in Behavioral Psychology from a small private college in the Shenandoah Valley, took a Creative Writing class, loved it, and published a short story called My Brother. He was a regular contributing writer to the college newspaper. Roger has two novels in print and ebook, Amish Snow and Yield Spread: a novel. Crystal Linn : I am an award-winning poet who has written all of my life. I have been blessed with the ability to write in several styles and formats. It is great fun co-authoring the Amish novels with Roger Rheinheimer. I look forward to writing more books with Roger, and to begin writing parenting books from my view point as a professional working with children and the adults in their lives. My home is in the Pacific Northwest with my husband and dog, Rosa. My hobbies include reading mysteries, writing, and sailing with family and friends.",[],4.5,2

Mother,"Kathleen Thompson Norris, Jennie Chancey (Editor)","This is a difficult age to be a woman. The woman who aspires to raise children for the glory of God, to develop the ministry of the home, or to co-labor with her husband is deemed “old-fashioned” or “unfulfilled.” The modern lure of independence and career has bewitched an entire generation to exchange the beauty of Christian womanhood for the temporary enticements of a society at war with the family.Amidst this confusion, Kathleen Norris’s Mother is a refreshing call to sanity. Mother is the fictional tale of a young lady who leaves home and repudiates family life in the hope of finding personal fulfillment through independence and a career. She decides that home life is a poor choice in the face of life in the big city. But God dramatically changes her heart as she realizes that wealth and position are illusory and that independence can enslave a young lady. She discovers that the greatest woman she has ever known is her mother and now she longs for home and motherhood.After reading this book, editor Jennie Chancey wrote, “That night, I opened the book, intending to read a chapter or two before bed. An hour passed before I realized how far I had read. I could not put the book down and finished it just shortly before midnight. As I turned the last page, tears filled my eyes. I knelt by my bed and asked God to forgive me for my bitterness and my unwillingness to trust and obey Him.”Vision Forum is pleased to offer this restored and revised version of the 1911 classic in the hope that girls will once again aspire to be like their mothers.This book may also be known as ""Belle-Mere"" as Triangle Books has such a title listed under this author's name.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Christian Fiction', 'Christian', 'Historical', 'Parenting', 'Inspirational', 'Family', 'Chick Lit']",3.95,1526

The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World,Eric Weiner (Goodreads Author),"Weiner spent a decade as a foreign correspondent reporting from such discontented locales as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Indonesia. Unhappy people living in profoundly unstable states, he notes, inspire pathos and make for good copy, but not for good karma. So Weiner, admitted grump and self-help book aficionado, undertook a year's research to travel the globe, looking for the ""unheralded happy places."" The result is this book, equal parts laugh-out-loud funny and philosophical, a journey into both the definition of and the destination for true contentment.Apparently, the happiest places on earth include, somewhat unexpectedly, Iceland, Bhutan, and India. Weiner also visits the country deemed most malcontent, Moldova, and finds real merit in the claim.But the question remains: What makes people happy? Is it the freedom of the West or the myriad restrictions of Singapore? The simple ashrams of India or the glittering shopping malls of Qatar?From the youthful drunkenness of Iceland to the despond of Slough, a sad but resilient town in Heathrow's flight path, Weiner offers wry yet profound observations about the way people relate to circumstance and fate.Both revealing and inspirational, perhaps the best thing about this hilarious trip across four continents is that for the reader, the ""geography of bliss"" is wherever they happen to find themselves while reading it.","['Nonfiction', 'Travel', 'Memoir', 'Psychology', 'Humor', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Self Help', 'Sociology', 'Book Club']",3.83,32094

Kokoda,Paul Ham (Goodreads Author),"For the first time ever, the compelling story of the infamous Kokoda Track campaign has been told from both sides of the conflict.In a unique and balanced portrayal, renowned journalist Paul Ham recounts both the Australian and Japanese perspectives of the events on the hellish Papuan jungle trail where thousands fought and died during World War II. Based on extensive research in Australia and Japan, and including previously unpublished documents, Kokoda intimately relates the stories of ordinary soldiers in 'the world's worst killing field', and examines the role of commanders in sending ill-equipped, unqualified Australian troops into battles that resulted in near 100 per cent casualty rates. It was a war without mercy, fought back and forth along 90 miles (145 km) of river crossings, steep inclines and precipitous descents, with both sides wracked by hunger and disease, and terrified of falling into enemy hands. Defeat was unthinkable: the Australian soldier was fighting for his homeland against an unyielding aggressor; the Japanese ordered to fight to the death in a bid to conquer 'Greater East Asia'. Paul Ham captures the spirits of those soldiers and commanders who clashed in this war of exceptional savagery, and tells of the brave souls on both sides of the campaign whose courage and sacrifices must never be forgotten.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Australia', 'World War II', 'War']",4.28,227

Awareness: The Key to Living in Balance,Osho,"Underlying all meditation techniques, including martial arts-and in fact underlying all great athletic performances-is a quality of being awake and present to the moment, a quality that Osho calls awareness. Once we can identify and understand what this quality of awareness is, we have the key to self-mastery in virtually every area of our lives.According to great masters like Lao Tzu or Buddha, most of us move through our lives like sleepwalkers. Never really present in what we are doing, never fully alert to our environment, and not even aware of what motivates us to do and say the things we do.At the same time, all of us have experienced moments of awareness-or awakening, to use another-in extraordinary circumstances. On the road, in a sudden and unexpected accident, time seems to stop and one is suddenly aware of every movement, every sound, every thought. Or in moments that touch us deeply-welcoming a new baby into the world for the first time, or being with someone at the moment of death.Awareness, says Osho, is the key to being self-directed, centered, and free in every aspect of our lives. In this book, Osho teaches how to live life more attentively, mindfully, and meditatively, with love, caring and consciousness.OSHO challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the ""1000 Makers of the 20th Century"" and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people-along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha-who have changed the destiny of India. More than a decade after his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.","['Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Psychology', 'New Age', 'Buddhism']",4.33,2141

The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays,"Oscar Wilde, Richard Allen Cave (Commentary)","Combining epigrammatic brilliance and shrewd social observation, the works collected in Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays are edited with an introduction, commentaries and notes by Richard Allen Cave in Penguin Classics.'To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness'The Importance of Being Earnest is a glorious comedy of mistaken identity, which ridicules codes of propriety and etiquette. Manners and morality are also victims of Wilde's sharp wit in Lady Windermere's Fan, A Woman of No Importance and An Ideal Husband, in which snobbery and hypocrisy are laid bare. In Salomé and A Florentine Tragedy, Wilde makes powerful use of historical settings to explore the complex relationship between sex and power. The range of these plays displays Wilde's delight in artifice, masks and disguises, and reveals the pretentions of the social world in which he himself played such a dazzling and precarious part.Richard Allen Cave's introduction and notes discuss the themes of the plays and Wilde's innovative methods of staging. This edition includes the excised 'Gribsby' scene from The Importance of Being Earnest.","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Drama', 'Literature', 'Theatre', 'Humor', '19th Century', 'British Literature', 'Irish Literature']",4.25,47211

The memories often concern a childhood in the Caribbean--family, manners, and landscape--as distilled and transformed by Kincaid's special style and vision.Kincaid leads her readers to consider, as if for the first time, the powerful ties between mother and child; the beauty and destructiveness of nature; the gulf between the masculine and the feminine; the significance of familiar things--a house, a cup, a pen.

Logos Rising: A History of Ultimate Reality,E. Michael Jones,"There has never been a time when there was nothing, because if there were ever nothing, there could never be something. There has never been a time when there was nothing but chaos. Order cannot come from chaos, because that which is cannot come from that which is not. There has never been a time when man was not aware of an ultimate reality upon which he depended for his existence. The first name man gave to that ultimate reality was God. In every language and culture, God was a father who lived in the sky. But if God was a father, did he have a beard? If God was a father, did he have a wife? The first attempt to deduce the characteristics of God from the world man knew, ended up in the dead end known as mythology, whose best expression was Homer’s Iliad. At around the same time that Homer’s epic went from oral to written form, a group of Greeks in Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor abandoned mythology and began to look for some substance in nature as the basis for ultimate reality. Thales of Miletus said it was water. Anaxamines said it was air, and Heraclitus said it was fire, but fire was an expression of something more basic, and he claimed that the most basic principle of all was Logos. Five hundred years later, St. John the Evangelist brought this discussion full circle when he said that in the beginning there was Logos, and Logos was God. God, it turns out, was a father, but he didn’t have a beard or a wife. God was Logos. Logos wasn’t simply an abstract principle like geometry or physics, although it certainly was both of those things. Logos was a person who had the power to bring that plan into fulfillment over the course of human history. Time was no longer just the number of motion, as Aristotle claimed. Time was a drama with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It was like the Greek plays Aristotle described in his Poetics. And because we were creatures of Logos we could now understand that plan in the same way that the Greeks of Athens understood Oedipus Rex. The history of logos found its culmination in the logos of history. Logos is rising. Logos Rising: A History of Ultimate Reality describes the tragic and yet ultimately triumphant progress of Logos in human history, from the beginning of everything, to the emergence of the concept, to the Democratic primary of 2020.","['Philosophy', 'History', 'Catholic', 'Christianity']",4.77,22

Rationality: From AI to Zombies,Eliezer Yudkowsky (Goodreads Author),"What does it actually mean to be rational? Not Hollywood-style ""rational,"" where you forsake all human feeling to embrace Cold Hard Logic. Real rationality, of the sort studied by psychologists, social scientists, and mathematicians. The kind of rationality where you make good decisions, even when it's hard; where you reason well, even in the face of massive uncertainty; where you recognize and make full use of your fuzzy intuitions and emotions, rather than trying to discard them. In ""Rationality: From AI to Zombies,"" Eliezer Yudkowsky explains the science underlying human irrationality with a mix of fables, argumentative essays, and personal vignettes. These eye-opening accounts of how the mind works (and how, all too often, it doesn't!) are then put to the test through some genuinely difficult puzzles: computer scientists' debates about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), physicists' debates about the relationship between the quantum and classical worlds, philosophers' debates about the metaphysics of zombies and the nature of morality, and many more. In the process, ""Rationality: From AI to Zombies"" delves into the human significance of correct reasoning more deeply than you'll find in any conventional textbook on cognitive science or philosophy of mind. A decision theorist and researcher at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, Yudkowsky published earlier drafts of his writings to the websites Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong. ""Rationality: From AI to Zombies"" compiles six volumes of Yudkowsky's essays into a single electronic tome. Collectively, these sequences of linked essays serve as a rich and lively introduction to the science—and the art—of human rationality.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Psychology', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Unfinished', 'Self Help', 'Technology', 'Logic', 'Education']",4.36,1168

"The Coup: 1953, the CIA, and the Roots of Modern U.S.-Iranian Relations",Ervand Abrahamian,"In August 1953, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency orchestrated the swift overthrow of Iran’s democratically elected leader and installed Muhammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in his place. Over the next twenty-six years, the United States backed the unpopular, authoritarian shah and his secret police; in exchange, it reaped a share of Iran’s oil wealth and became a key player in this volatile region.The blowback was almost inevitable, as this new and revealing history of the coup and its consequences shows. When the 1979 Iranian Revolution deposed the shah and replaced his puppet government with a radical Islamic republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the shift reverberated throughout the Middle East and the world, casting a long, dark shadow over U.S.-Iran relations that extends to the present day.In this authoritative new history of the coup and its aftermath, noted Iran scholar Ervand Abrahamian uncovers little-known documents that challenge conventional interpretations and also sheds new light on how the American role in the coup influenced U.S.-Iranian relations, both past and present. Drawing from the hitherto closed archives of British Petroleum, the Foreign Office, and the U.S. State Department, as well as from Iranian memoirs and published interviews, Abrahamian’s riveting account of this key historical event will change America’s understanding of a crucial turning point in modern U.S.-Iranian relations.","['History', 'Iran', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Espionage', 'International Relations', 'Sociology', 'Military Fiction']",4.14,343

Love Overboard,Janet Evanovich (Goodreads Author),"Dear Reader:In a previous life, before the time of Plum, I wrote twelve short romance novels. Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All went out-of-print immediately and then could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales.I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now beingre-released by HarperCollins. Love Overboard is second inthe lineup, and it's presented here in almost original form. I've done only minor editing to correct some embarrassing bloopers missed the first time around. And I changed the title because I thought the original title (Ivan Takes a Wife) was boring!Love Overboard is a romantic tale about a handsome ship'scaptain; a wary wench from Jersey City; a hundred-year-old, two-masted schooner; and an entire town of shoemakers. There's some getting naked, some blueberry pie, more getting naked, and at the end . . . Okay, I won't tell you about the end, but it's really good and it'll make you feel happy.I took my family on the road trip from heck to research this book.

The Heavenly Man: The Remarkable True Story of Chinese Christian Brother Yun,"Paul Hattaway, Brother Yun","The dramatic autobiography of one of China's dedicated, courageous, and intensely persecuted house church leaders.

Instead of focusing on the many miracles or experiences of suffering, however, Yun prefers to focus on the character and beauty of Jesus.

But what they weren’t prepared for was the smoke ring–an immense gaseous envelope that had formed around a neutron star directly in their path. The Smoke Ring was home to a variety of plant and animal life-forms evolved to thrive in conditions of continual free-fall. When Discipline encountered it, something went wrong. The crew abandoned ship and fled to the unlikely space oasis.Five hundred years later, the descendants of the Discipline crew living on the Smoke Ring no longer remember their origins. Earth is more myth than memory, and no recollection of the State remains. But Kendy remembers. And just outside the Smoke Ring, Discipline waits patiently to make contact with its wayward children.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Speculative Fiction', 'Space Opera', 'Novels', 'Hard Science Fiction', 'Sci Fi Fantasy', 'Adult']",3.71,3430

First published in France in 1975, it is the major theoretical work of one of the foremost thinkers in Europe today.Castoriadis offers a brilliant and far-reaching analysis of the unique character of the social-historical world and its relations to the individual, to language, and to nature. He argues that most traditional conceptions of society and history overlook the essential feature of the social-historical world, namely that this world is not articulated once and for all but is in each case the creation of the society concerned. In emphasizing the element of creativity, Castoriadis opens the way for rethinking political theory and practice in terms of the autonomous and explicit self-institution of society.","['Philosophy', 'Politics', 'Sociology', 'Nonfiction', 'History', 'Theory', 'Psychology', 'Psychoanalysis']",4.33,207

Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again,Donald J. Trump,"Look at the state of the world right now. It’s a terrible mess, and that’s putting it mildly. There has never been a more dangerous time. The politicians and special interests in Washington, DC, are directly responsible for the mess we are in. So why should we continue listening to them?It’s time to bring America back to its rightful owners—the American people. I’m not going to play the same game politicians have been playing for decades—all talk, no action, while special interests and lobbyists dictate our laws. I am shaking up the establishment on both sides of the political aisle because I can’t be bought. I want to bring America back, to make it great and prosperous again, and to be sure we are respected by our allies and feared by our adversaries. It’s time for action. Americans are fed up with politics as usual. And they should be! In this book, I outline my vision to make America great again, including: how to fix our failing economy; how to reform health care so it is more efficient, cost-effective, and doesn’t alienate both doctors and patients; how to rebuild our military and start winning wars—instead of watching our enemies take over—while keeping our promises to our great veterans; how to ensure that our education system offers the resources that allow our students to compete internationally, so tomorrow’s jobseekers have the tools they need to succeed; and how to immediately bring jobs back to America by closing our doors to illegal immigrants, and pressuring businesses to produce their goods at home. This book is my blueprint for how to Make America Great Again. It’s not hard. We just need someone with the courage to say what needs to be said.","['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Presidents', 'Business', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'History', 'American History', 'Political Science']",3.45,4238
Manhattan Transfer,"John Dos Passos, Maurice-Edgar Coindreau (Traduction)","Considered by many to be John Dos Passos's greatest work, Manhattan Transfer is an ""expressionistic picture of New York"" (New York Times) in the 1920s that reveals the lives of wealthy power brokers and struggling immigrants alike. From Fourteenth Street to the Bowery, Delmonico's to the underbelly of the city waterfront, Dos Passos chronicles the lives of characters struggling to become a part of modernity before they are destroyed by it.More than seventy-five years after its first publication, Manhattan Transfer still stands as ""a novel of the very first importance"" (Sinclair Lewis). It is a masterpiece of modern fiction and a lasting tribute to the dual-edged nature of the American dream.","['Fiction', 'Classics', 'American', 'New York', 'The United States Of America', '20th Century', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical Fiction', 'Americana']",3.68,4779
The Book About Blanche and Marie,"Per Olov Enquist, Tiina Nunnally (Translation)","In The Book about Blanche and Marie, Enquist has once again found inspiration from the historical record, this time exploring the fascinatingly complex relationship between two of the twentieth century’s most remarkable women: Blanche Wittman, the famous hysteria patient of Professor J.M. Charcot at Salpetriére Hospital outside Paris, and Marie Curie, the Polish physicist and Nobel Prize winner. While the scientist tries to understand the nature of radiation, Blanche, her assistant and, at the time of her death, a triple amputee as a result of exposure to radiation, fills three notebooks with her exploration of a deceptively simple question: What is love? The Book about Blanche and Marie is at once a haunting look at scientific martyrdom and an intimate moving portrait of a friendship between two uniquely brave and talented women.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Swedish Literature', 'Contemporary', 'Sweden', 'France', 'Scandinavian Literature', 'Novels', 'Historical', 'Literature']",3.36,1170
"Blackamoores: Africans in Tudor England, Their Presence, Status and Origins",Onyeka,"Do we imagine English history as a book with white pages and no black letters in? We sometimes think of Tudor England in terms of gaudy costumes, the court of Henry VIII and Elizabeth I and perhaps Shakespearian romance. Onyeka's book acknowledges this predilection but challenges our perceptions. Onyeka's book is about the presence, status and origins of Africans in Tudor England. In it Onyeka argues that these people were present in cities and towns throughout England, but that they did not automatically occupy the lowest positions in Tudor society. This is important because the few modern historians who have written about Africans in Tudor England suggest that they were all slaves, or transient immigrants who were considered as dangerous strangers and the epitome of otherness. However, this book will show that some Africans in England had important occupations in Tudor society, and were employed by powerful people because of the skills they possessed. These people seem to have inherited some of their skills from the multicultural societies that they came from, but that does not mean all of those present in England were born in other countries: some were born in England. The arguments in this book are supported by evidence from a variety of sources both manuscript and printed, most of which has not been widely discussed - whilst some of it Onyeka has discovered, and this may be the first time that it has been revealed. Other evidence is taken from texts that are the subject of popular discussion by historians, linguists and so on, but Onyeka encourages the reader to re-examine these works in a different way because they reveal information about the presence, status and origins of Africans in Tudor England.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Race', 'Anti Racist', 'Historical', 'World History', 'British Literature', 'Cultural', 'Research', 'European History']",4.35,80
"The Fisherman & His Soul, The Star-Child, and Other Stories","Oscar Wilde, Michael Wilson (Editor)","The stories in this volume have been published in the past under the title ""Stories for Children,"" which is the one thing the majority of them decidedly are not. It is well-documented that prior to their publication many of the stories were told by Oscar Wilde at dinner parties, where he always commanded the stage, and that alone should indicate his intended audience was adults. The stories were originally published in two volumes, and when asked directly if such intricate stories in the second volume as ""The Fisherman and His Soul"" were intended for children, Wilde replied, ""I had about as much intention of pleasing the British child as I did of pleasing the British public."" That disclaimer aside, there is much for adults to like in these deceptively simple tales, which only recently have begun to receive their due as serious literature.",[],4.44,18

What They Asked Me: The Fear of Living and Dying Young,Mwanandeke Kindembo (Goodreads Author),"This small book was written by Mr. Mwanandeke Kindembo. The author focused on answering some crucial questions asked by different people. Therefore, he decided to combine all the minds into One by giving general answers upon each question posed. These answers are his own opinions based upon what he experienced in life. In other words, “feel think” instead of “think feel”. These answers were provided to act as motivational as well as illuminating the minds instead of arousing only. It is unknown whether he is a naturalist, idealist or realist. But the answers seem to offer that first-hand experience instead of mere facts that doesn’t lead anywhere. It’s given therefore upon the reader to decide on his/her own conclusion of this little book of questionnaires. Instead of focusing on the famous sentence “arise, ye who are dead”.

La ragazza con la Leica,Helena Janeczek,"ROMANZO VINCITORE DEL PREMIO STREGA 2018 «Così era finita Gerda Taro, per non aver voluto abbandonare il fronte quando non c’era più nessuna speranza, ed era rimasta ferita a morte come tanti altri, in una strada polverosa; lasciò nelle sue foto testimonianza dell’enorme delitto che era stata la guerra. Aveva dedicato la sua splendida vita a un degno compito, a una giusta causa persa.»Questo libro racconta la vita di questa ragazza ribelle, l'amore con Robert Capa, l'avventura di fotografare e la gioia di vivere nella Parigi degli anni Trenta.Il 1° agosto 1937 una sfilata piena di bandiere rosse attraversa Parigi. È il corteo funebre per Gerda Taro, la prima fotografa caduta su un campo di battaglia. Proprio quel giorno, avrebbe compiuto ventisette anni. Robert Capa, in prima fila, è distrutto: erano stati felici insieme, lui le aveva insegnato a usare la Leica e poi erano partiti tutti e due per la Guerra di Spagna. Nella folla seguono altri che sono legati a Gerda da molto prima che diventasse la ragazza di Capa: Ruth Cerf, l’amica di Lipsia, con cui ha vissuto i tempi più duri a Parigi dopo la fuga dalla Germania; Willy Chardack, che si è accontentato del ruolo di cavalier servente da quando l’irresistibile ragazza gli ha preferito Georg ­Kuritzkes, impegnato a combattere nelle Brigate Internazionali. Per tutti Gerda ­rimarrà una presenza più forte e viva della celebrata eroina antifascista: Gerda li ha spesso delusi e feriti, ma la sua gioia di ­vivere, la sua sete di libertà sono scintille capaci di riaccendersi anche a distanza di decenni. Basta una telefonata intercontinentale tra Willy e Georg, che si sentono per tutt’altro motivo, a dare l’avvio a un romanzo caleidoscopico, costruito sulle fonti originali, del quale Gerda è il cuore pulsante. È il suo battito a tenere insieme un flusso che allaccia epoche e luoghi lontani, restituendo vita alle istantanee di questi ragazzi degli anni Trenta alle prese con la crisi economica, l’ascesa del nazismo, l’ostilità verso i rifugiati che in Francia colpiva soprattutto chi era ebreo e di sinistra, come loro. Ma per chi l’ha amata, quella giovinezza resta il tempo in cui, finché Gerda è vissuta, tutto sembrava ancora possibile.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Photography', 'Italy', 'Italian Literature', 'Womens', 'Novels', 'Spanish Civil War', 'Historical', 'Audiobook']",2.75,1153

Thérèse Raquin,"Émile Zola, Robin Buss (Translator)","One of Zola's most famous realist novels, Therese Raquin is a clinically observed, sinister tale of adultery and murder among the lower classes in nineteenth-century Parisian society.Set in the claustrophobic atmosphere of a dingy haberdasher's shop in the passage du Pont-Neuf in Paris, this powerful novel tells how the heroine and her lover, Laurent, kill her husband, Camille, but are subsequently haunted by visions of the dead man, and prevented from enjoying the fruits of their crime.Zola's shocking tale dispassionately dissects the motivations of his characters--mere ""human beasts"", who kill in order to satisfy their lust--and stands as a key manifesto of the French Naturalist movement, of which the author was the founding father. Published in 1867, this is Zola's most important work before the Rougon-Macquart series and introduces many of the themes that can be traced through the later novel cycle.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'France', 'French Literature', '19th Century', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Crime', 'Historical Fiction']",3.72,21188

The Godfather Doctrine: A Foreign Policy Parable,"John C. Hulsman, A. Wess Mitchell","The Godfather Doctrine draws clear and essential lessons from perhaps the greatest Hollywood movie ever made to illustrate America's changing geopolitical place in the world and how our country can best meet the momentous strategic challenges it faces. In the movie The Godfather, Don Corleone, head of New York's most powerful organized-crime family, is shockingly gunned down in broad daylight, leaving his sons Sonny and Michael, along with his adopted son, consigliere Tom Hagen, to chart a new course for the family. In The Godfather Doctrine, John Hulsman and Wess Mitchell show how the aging and wounded don is emblematic of cold-war American power on the decline in a new world where our enemies play by unfamiliar rules, and how the don's heirs uncannily exemplify the three leading schools of American foreign policy today. Tom, the left-of-center liberal institutionalist, thinks the old rules still apply and that negotiation is the answer. Sonny is the Bush-era neocon who shoots first and asks questions later, proving an easy target for his enemies. Only Michael, the realist, has a sure feel for the changing scene, recognizing the need for flexible combinations of soft and hard power to keep the family strong and maintain its influence and security in a dangerous and rapidly changing world. Based on Hulsman and Mitchell's groundbreaking and widely debated article, Pax Corleone, The Godfather Doctrine explains for everyone why Francis Ford Coppola's epic story about a Mafia dynasty holds key insights for ensuring America's survival in the twenty-first century.-- ""Boston Globe""",['Nonfiction'],3.83,64

No Man's Land: What to Do When Your Company Is Too Big to Be Small but TooSmall to Be Big,Doug Tatum,"“I travel the country speaking about No Man’s Land to entrepreneurs and business leaders. Wherever I go, I get the same response. Listeners approach me with sadness in their eyes and say, ‘Doug, if only I had known about No Man’s Land when I was running my company, we might still be in business.’”—Doug Tatum If starting a company is difficult, leading a company once the business has caught fire is infinitely more so. Thousands each year approach the dangerous transition that Doug Tatum calls No Man’s Land—when they are too big to be considered small but still too small to be considered big. Rapid growth is every entrepreneur’s dream, but it never comes easily and is usually rife with dilemmas. During No Man’s Land, as in human adolescence, such growth should spark self- discovery, acquired discipline, and positive but difficult transition. Unfortunately, it often becomes an agonizing battle between the natural tendencies of a lonely entrepreneur and certain immutable laws of growth. The result is confusion, frustration, stagnation, loss of employee morale, and, at worst, financial failure. Sounds pretty bleak. The good news is that Doug Tatum knows exactly what it takes to get through No Man’s Land: a map, a high place from which to orient yourself, and navigational rules to help you track your progress. And these tools are here in this book. Through case studies and stories of successes and failures, No Man’s Land will help you learn how to: * Align your growing company with its market. * Execute the necessary changes in your management. * Confirm that your financial model is scalable. * Attract money and make smart decisions about financing your business. If you’re an entrepreneur, this book will help you make your company all it can be and all you want it to be.

After surveying eighteen leading high school American history texts, he has concluded that not one does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable.

Fire of the Covenant: The Story of the Willie and Martin Handcart Companies,Gerald N. Lund (Goodreads Author),"In the summer of 1856, three companies of handcarts were outfitted and sent west from Iowa to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake. All went well, and they arrived without undue incident. But two additional companies - one captained by James G. Willie, and the other by Edward Martin - left England late in the season. When they arrived at Iowa City, they were long past the time for safe departure across the plains. By the time they left Florence, Nebraska, with still more than a thousand miles to go, it was near the end of August.

Lund has used the same techniques present in The Work and the Glory series to blend fictional characters into the tapestry of actual historical events, making this a story filled with all the elements of great drama - tragedy, triumph, pathos, courage, sacrifice, surrender and faith.","['Historical Fiction', 'Lds', 'Religion', 'Lds Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Church', 'Inspirational', 'Christian Fiction', 'Spirituality']",4.55,7790

Intelligence: The Creative Response to Now,Osho,"In Intelligence, Osho challenges the common conception that the best way to promote intelligence is to train the intellect. Intellect is logical, he says; intelligence is paradoxical. Intellect takes things apart to see how they work; intelligence puts things together to see the functioning of the whole. Osho posits that when our education systems put too much emphasis on developing intellect, an imbalance is created and both the individual and the society suffer. It is only through intelligence that we can respond creatively to the challenges of a changing world. The Insights for a New Way of Living series aims to shine light on beliefs and attitudes that prevent individuals from being their true selves. The text is an artful mix of compassion and humor, and readers are encouraged to confront what they would most like to avoid, which in turn provides the key to true insight and power.By exploring the distinction between intellect and intelligence, Intelligence encourages readers to be more aware of how they approach problems---logical, emotional, and practical---and how they solve them.Osho challenges the idea that the best way to promote intelligence is to train the intellect.

An Ideal Husband,Oscar Wilde,"Although Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) created a wide range of poetry, essays, and fairy tales (and one novel) in his brief, tragic life, he is perhaps best known as a dramatist. His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.An Ideal Husband revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards — providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. An Ideal Husband is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication.","['Classics', 'Plays', 'Fiction', 'Drama', 'Humor', '19th Century', 'Literature', 'Theatre', 'Romance', 'British Literature']",4.04,36145

Vie devant soi de Romain Gary (Émile Ajar),Éliane Lecarme-Tabone,"Le lecteur actuel de ""La vie devant soi"" lit ce roman comme une oeuvre de Romain Gary dont le pseudonyme, Émile Ajar, se trouve seulement indiqué entre parenthèses sur la couverture. Il peut donc se poser les véritables questions sur la valeur littéraire du roman ainsi que sur ses significations, et envisager sereinement l'ensemble Gary-Ajar. Celui de 1975, en revanche, découvrait, lui, un livre signé Ajar, dont la nouveauté le séduisait ou l'irritait, mais qu'il appréhendait à travers un tapage médiatico-littéraire, paroxystique au moment de sa publication.

Moromeții I,Marin Preda,"Originalitatea romanului Moromeţii stă fără îndoială în noua viziune asupra lumii rurale.Cele două volume conţin povestea unei familii de ţărani din Câmpia Dunării, mai precis din satul teleormănean Siliştea-Gumeşti, care cunoaşte, de-a lungul unui sfert de secol, o adâncă şi simbolică destrămare.În volumul I satul e înfăţişat cu câţiva ani înaintea celui de-al doilea război mondial, în vara anului 1937, într-o perioadă de relativă sau iluzorie stabilitate socială, perioadă în care timpul era foarte răbdător cu oamenii.Spre deosebire de înaintaşi, care au văzut satul din Câmpia Dunării zbuciumat, angajat in acţiuni disperate, Marin Preda descrie, în primul volum din Moromeţii un sat în care nu se petrec drame zguduitoare, formidabile răsturnări şi unde nu clocoteşte răzvrătirea. Traiul populaţiei din Siliştea-Gumeşti nu e uşor deloc, decât pentru câteva familii înstărite, familiile unora ca alde Aristide, Cotelici, Bălosu sau Iocan, dar nici peste măsură de amărât nu este. Îi apasă pe mulţi impozitele, fonciirea şi alte neajunsuri dar ele pot fi încă suportate de oameni, care se adună cu plăcere duminica, la taifas, în poiana lui Iocan unde citesc ziare, povestesc anecdote, glumesc, angajându-se în adevărate dueluri ale inteligenţei.Siliştea-Gumeşti este o comună mare, cu două biserici, o şcoală cu patru sute cincizeci de elevi înscrişi şi vreo şapte învăţători. Hotarul comunei cuprinde, loturi mai vaste sau mai restrânse ale ţăranilor şi moşia Marica, vegheată cu străşnicie de un paznic. Afară de bogătaşii satului, care au case mari, ţăranii ceilalţi vieţuiesc în case cu două sau trei camere şi chiar in bordeie.Gospodăria Moromeţilor pare solidă şi grija conducătorului ei este s-o menţină intactă. E pentru întâia oară când în literatura română ţăranul nu este stăpânit de ideea de a avea pământ, ca şansă a fericirii sale, ci de a şi-l păstra.","['Romanian Literature', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'School', 'Romania', 'Literature', 'Read For School', '20th Century', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction']",3.86,8713

Amphigorey,Edward Gorey,"The title of this deliciously creepy collection of Gorey's work stems from the word amphigory, meaning a nonsense verse or composition. As always, Gorey's painstakingly cross-hatched pen and ink drawings are perfectly suited to his oddball verse and prose. The first book of 15, ""The Unstrung Harp,"" describes the writing process of novelist Mr. Clavius Frederick Earbrass: ""He must be mad to go on enduring the unexquisite agony of writing when it all turns out drivel."" In ""The Listing Attic,"" you'll find a set of quirky limericks such as ""A certain young man, it was noted, / Went about in the heat thickly coated; / He said, 'You may scoff, / But I shan't take it off; / Underneath I am horribly bloated.' ""Many of Gorey's tales involve untimely deaths and dreadful mishaps, but much like tragic Irish ballads with their perky rhythms and melodies, they come off as strangely lighthearted. ""The Gashlycrumb Tinies,"" for example, begins like this: ""A is for AMY who fell down the stairs, B is for BASIL assaulted by bears,"" and so on. An eccentric, funny book for either the uninitiated or diehard Gorey fans.Contains: The Unstrung Harp, The Listing Attic, The Doubtful Guest, The Object Lesson, The Bug Book, The Fatal Lozenge, The Hapless Child, The Curious Sofa, The Willowdale Handcar, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, The Insect God, The West Wing, The Wuggly Ump, The Sinking Spell, and The Remembered Visit.","['Art', 'Graphic Novels', 'Humor', 'Comics', 'Fiction', 'Poetry', 'Horror', 'Short Stories', 'Picture Books', 'Gothic']",4.04,44294

Chance and Necessity,Jacques Monod,"This radical book by Nobel laureate Monod is an important intellectual event. Chance and Necessity is a philosophical statement whose intention is to sweep away as both false and dangerous the animist conception of man that has dominated virtually all Western worldviews from primitive cultures to those of dialectical materialists. He bases his argument on the evidence of modern biology, which indisputably shows, that man is the product of chance genetic mutation. With the unrelenting logic of the scientist, he draws upon what we now know (and can theorize) of genetic structure to suggest an new way of looking at ourselves. He argues that objective scientific knowledge, the only reliable knowledge, denies the concepts of destiny or evolutionary purpose that underlie traditional philosophies. He contends that the persistence of those concepts is responsible for the intensifying schizophrenia of a world that accepts, and lives by, the fruits of science while refusing to face its moral implications. Dismissing as ""animist"" not only Plato, Hegel, Bergson and Teilhard de Chardin but Spencer and Marx as well, he calls for a new ethic that will recognize the distinction between objective knowledge and the realm of values--an ethic of knowledge that can, perhaps, save us from our deepening spiritual malaise, from the new age of darkness he sees coming.PrefaceOf strange objects Vitalisms and animisms Maxwell's demons Microscopic cyberneticsMolecular ontogenesis Invariance and perturbationsEvolution The frontiers The kingdom and the darknessAppendixes","['Science', 'Philosophy', 'Biology', 'Nonfiction', 'Evolution', 'Religion', 'France', 'Physics', 'Popular Science', 'Classics']",4.13,649

The specific musical references follow, accompanied by their sources and an examination of the role each plays in the work.While the author considers the early works with equal care, the bulk of this volume explores the musical resonances of Ulysses, especially as they affect the style, structure, characterization, and themes. Like motifs in Wagnerian opera, some allusions introduce and later remind us of characters--bits of Molly's songs for instance constantly intrude her impending adultery on Bloom's consciousness. Other motifs are linked to concerns such as Stephen's Oedipal guilt over his mother's death, which in turn connects to his preoccupation with Shakespeare, the creator, the father, and the cuckold. Music helps create the bond which briefly joins Stephen and Bloom, and music augments the entire grand theme of consubstantiality.Professor Bowen's style is simple and clear, allowing Joycean artifice to speak for itself.The volume includes a bibliography.",[],3.6,5

Delusion in Death,J.D. Robb (Goodreads Author),"After years on the force, Eve Dallas didn't think she could be shocked anymore... until now.It was just another after-work happy-hour bar downtown, where business professionals unwound with a few drinks, complained about the boss, maybe hooked up with someone for the night. Until something went terribly wrong. At first it was just a friction in the air. The noise intensified. The crowd seemed oppressive. some sharp words were exchanged, some pushing and shoving. Then the madness descended. And after twelve minutes of chaos and violence, eighty people lay dead.Eve Dallas is trying to sort out the inexplicable events. Surviving witnesses talk about seeing things—monsters and swarms of bees. They describe sudden, overwhelming feelings of fear and rage and paranoia. When forensics makes its report, the mass delusions make more sense: it appears the bar patrons were exposed to a cocktail of chemicals and illegal drugs that could drive people to temporary insanity—if not kill them outright.But that doesn't explain who would unleash such horror—or why. Eve's husband, Roarke, happens to own the bar, yet he's convinced the attack wasn't directed at him. It's bigger than that. And if Eve can't figure it out fast, it could happen again, anytime, anywhere. Because it's airborne....","['Mystery', 'Romance', 'Crime', 'Fiction', 'Futuristic', 'Romantic Suspense', 'Suspense', 'Science Fiction', 'Thriller', 'Mystery Thriller']",4.34,21777

Target This,Lily White (Goodreads Author),"I’m not sure what I was thinking that day. It was a normal Thursday, nothing new or exciting had occurred in the morning. I’d risen from bed, taken a shower and brushed my teeth. I’d then jumped on the 8:05 bus that ran a short distance between my house and the county library where I worked. The ride took its usual 15 minutes before it left me standing fresh faced in front of a building of gothic construction that was my favorite place in the world. After straightening my knee length skirt, I pushed open the door that led into the interior of the library. It was at that moment that my world would change – impossibly and forever. It was a fateful movement of wood that collided with the shoulder of a man that would alter my very existence. It wasn’t fear that I felt at that moment – more like the feeling of being watched. It was the feeling of knowing that danger lurks - the sensation of the hair standing on end at the back of your neck. Looking back on a moment that happened so many months ago, I now realize that I should have listened to that feeling. As I would later find out, the man standing in front of me referred to himself as Master Lucas… …and I was his next target.

Timaeus and Critias,"Plato, Desmond Lee (Translator)","Taking the form of dialogues between Socrates, Timaeus, Critias and Hermocrates, these two works are among Plato's final writings. In Timaeus, he gives a thorough account of the world in which we live, describing a cosmos composed of four elements earth, air, fire and water which combine to give existence to all things. An exploration of the origins of the universe, life and humanity, which outlines not just physical laws but also metaphysical and religious principles, it remained a paradigm of science for two thousand years. The mysterious preamble to Timaeus contains the first account in literature of Atlantis, while the fragmentary Critias, unfinished by its author, provides a spellbinding description of the lost continent's ideal society, which Critias asserts was created by the god-like children of Poseidon himself.","['Philosophy', 'Classics', 'Nonfiction', 'Ancient', 'Greece', 'Ancient History', 'Mythology', 'Science', 'Academic', 'History']",3.88,1357

Eight years later, a schoolteacher who lived four miles away gave birth to a boy whose cherubic smile belied the fast growing tumors that soon riddled his face and chest.

Yoga The Science of Well-Being,Amit Ray,"This book covers yoga as a part of comprehensive human well-being strategy. The wide scope of yoga as a policy of well-being is explained. Traditionally, science of well-being has been considered as a branch of social science. However, it is currently considered as an interdisciplinary science that collaborates with other fields such as medicine, neuroscience, neurobiology, physiology, chemistry, psychology, genetics, behavioral science, social science and economics. Science of well-being includes physical well-being, mental well-being, spiritual well-being and social well-being. In the book Dr. Ray explains how yoga is related to all these four aspects of well-being. Yoga has four central components: physical yoga, energy yoga, action-yoga and wisdom-yoga. Each of these four domains is related to a different meaning of the scientifically clumsy term “well-being,” and each has its own road to happiness. . Throughout the life our song changes, in the young age we need education at the older age we need protection and care. Therefore life has many levels of well-being. Yoga deals with all levels of well-being in a systematic manner. The author does a great job explaining what yoga can offer for the well-being of individual and for the society as a whole.","['Inspirational', 'Self Help', 'Spirituality']",4.93,28

Loss De Plott,Stephan J. Myers (Goodreads Author),"""A fable for grownups who believe it is never too late to change.""Don't let the illustrations fool you; Loss De Plott is as thought provoking as it gets. A fable for grownups, who believe it is never too late to change and understand the power of now, Loss will re-ignite your hunger for answers and will take you on a journey of discovery, where the stakes could not be higher.A chilling view of the future unfolds as the boundaries of time unravel and characters that might well shape our future are revealed. Meet Slothman, Wordsmith and the haunting Dark Whisperers and you will learn that it really is never too late to change.Myers has created a truly unique blending of illustrations and words, in a book that is impossible to put down. Written with a Dickensian lilt and the cadence of a musical score; the tale is told by a mysterious narrator who wakes, without his memory, only to find the elfin like Loss levitating before him.""What ......does it look like,"" she asks. And when a parade of odd looking doors appear in his mind he realizes that, if he is to resolve the mystery of his peculiar circumstances, there are answers he must find. Thus begins a fable that, by revealing what is really important in life, might well change your view of the world forever.Simple, yet deceptively complex, fragments of this endearing fable can be found in literature, religions and philosophies across the centuries. Yet, when all is said and done, they come down to one solitary word. A word that has both the power to create; the power to destroy the world of tomorrow and upon which rests the future of children everywhere.In the words of Stephan J Myers......Even in this digital age there is no diary we might consult more than that of memory and it often seems to me that the oldest of memories linger longest for the dreams that never die. Constant whispers that remind us all of those halcyon days of youth, when the great expectations for our lives ahead were yet untainted by the realities of life.That everything changes is perhaps the most enduring of universal truths. Yet even that for which we have most longed might often be tinged by sadness, for fundamental to change are the choices we must make. With the years I have come to realise that each step we take in life might be regretted once we begin to dwell upon those other steps we might have taken. More, there seems to me a time for each of us when we might ask what if?Loss De Plott is above all the sum of those choices we might make. Unashamedly written with a Dickensian lilt and some rather quirky illustrations I wanted to write a book which the reader could not skim across the pages, but be encouraged to find an accord between images and words. Both mediums layered upon each other with the greatest of care, that they might reflect the simplicity and complexity with which we weave the patterns of our lives. More, I want you to never forget the characters Loss meets on her travels. The gross Slothman, the devilish Teller Of Tales and of course the Whisperers In The Dark.Find the rhythm in the words and reach once again for those halcyon days of youth. So that we might never forget we are each and every one of us the stuff of dreams and though we might be grownups, it is never too late to change.Stephan J Myers, July 2012.",[],4.32,34

Mawson's Will: The Greatest Polar Survival Story Ever Written,"Lennard Bickel, Edmund Hillary (Foreword by)","Mawson's Will is the dramatic story of what Sir Edmund Hillary calls ""the most outstanding solo journey ever recorded in Antarctic history."" For weeks in Antarctica, Douglas Mawson faced some of the most daunting conditions ever known to man: blistering wind, snow, and cold; loss of his companion, his dogs and supplies, the skin on his hands and the soles of his feet; thirst, starvation, disease, snowblindness - and he survived. Sir Douglas Mawson is remembered as the young Australian who would not go to the South Pole with Robert Scott in 1911, choosing instead to lead his own expedition on the less glamorous mission of charting nearly 1,500 miles of Antarctic coastline and claiming its resources for the British Crown. His party of three set out through the mountains across glaciers in 60-mile-per-hour winds. Six weeks and 320 miles out, one man fell into a crevasse, along with the tent, most of the equipment, all of the dogs' food, and all except a week's supply of the men's provisions.Mawson's Will is the unforgettable story of one man's ingenious practicality and unbreakable spirit and how he continued his meticulous scientific observations even in the face of death. When the expedition was over, Mawson had added more territory to the Antarctic map than anyone else of his time. Thanks to Bickel's moving account, Mawson can be remembered for the vision and dedication that make him one of the world's great explorers.","['Nonfiction', 'Adventure', 'History', 'Survival', 'Travel', 'Biography', 'Outdoors', 'Science', 'Memoir', 'Biography Memoir']",4.26,1371

Revenge,Yōko Ogawa,"A woman goes into a bakery to buy a strawberry cream tart. The place is immaculate but there is no one serving so she waits. Another customer comes in. The woman tells the new arrival that she is buying her son a treat for his birthday. Every year she buys him his favourite cake; even though he died in an accident when he was six years old. From this beginning Yoko Ogawa weaves a dark and beautiful narrative that pulls together a seemingly disconnected cast of characters. In the tradition of classical Japanese poetic collections, the stories in Revenge are linked through recurring images and motifs, as each story follows on from the one before while simultaneously introducing new characters and themes. Filled with breathtaking images, Ogawa provides us with a slice of life that is resplendent in its chaos, enthralling in its passion and chilling in its cruelty.","['Short Stories', 'Horror', 'Fiction', 'Japan', 'Japanese Literature', 'Asia', 'Literary Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Asian Literature', 'Mystery']",3.9,7376

Spiritus Mundi - The Romance,Robert Sheppard (Goodreads Author),"Spiritus Mundi by Robert Sheppard, nominated for the prestigious 2014 Pushcart Prize for Literature, consists of Spiritus Mundi, the Novel—Book I, and Spiritus Mundi, the Romance—Book II. Book I’s espionage-terror-political-religious thriller-action criss-crosses the globe from Beijing to London to Washington, Mexico City and Jerusalem presenting a vast panorama of the contemporary international world, including compelling action, deep and realistic characters and surreal adventures, while Book II dialates the setting and scope into a fantasy (though still rooted in the real) adventure where the protagonists embark on a quest to the realms of Middle Earth and its Crystal Bead Game and through a wormhole to the Council of the Immortals in the Amphitheater in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy in search of the crucial Silmaril Crystal, and to plead for the continuance of the human race in the face of threatened extinction from a nuclear World War III, all followed by a triple-somersault thriller ending in which a common garden-variety terrorist attack is first uncovered by MI6 and the CIA as the opening gambit a Greatpower Game of States threatening World War III and then, incredibly, as the nexus of a Time Travel conspiracy involving an attempt by fascist forces of the 23rd Century to alter a benign World History by a time-travelling raid on their past and our present to provoke that World War III, foiled by the heroic efforts of the democratic 23rd Century world government, the Senate of the United States of Earth, to hunt down the fascist interlopers before their history is irrevocably altered for evil. When activist Robert Sartorius, leading a global campaign to create a European Parliament-style world-wide United Nations Parliamentary Assembly presses the proposal in New York on his old friend the UN Secretary-General and is rebuffed due to the hostile pressure of the conservative American administration, his Committee resolves to fight back by launching a celebrity-driven Bono-Geldof-Band Aid/Live 8-style “People Power” media campaign and telethon spearheaded by rock superstars Isis and Osiris and former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to mobilize global public support and pressure in alliance with the Occupy Wall Street Movements worldwide. The Blogs of Sartorius, activist Eva Strong and Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy reveal the campaign’s working struggle, their tangled love affairs, a loss of faith, attempted suicide, reconciliation of father and son after divorce, and recovery of personal love and faith. Things fall apart as the idealists’ global crusade is infiltrated by a cell of jihadist terrorists using it as a cover, then counter-infiltrated by CIA agent Jack McKinsey and British MI6 agent Etienne Dearlove. A cat-and-mouse game of espionage and intrigue ensues pitting them against the Chinese MSS espionage network allied with the Iranian Quds Force crossing Beijing, London, Moscow, Washington and Jerusalem unleashing an uncontrollable series of events which sees the American Olympic Track and Field Team bombed on an airplane in London, uncovers a secret conspiracy of China, Russia and Iran to jointly seize the oil reserves of the Middle-East, and witnesses Presidents Clinton and Carter taken hostage with Sartorius, McKinsey, Eva and other activists at a Jerusalem telethon rally cut short by the explosion of a concealed atomic device in a loaned Chinese Terracotta Warrior, then flown by capturing terrorists to Qom, Iran as “human shields” to deter a retaliatory nuclear attack.In Book II, Spiritus Mundi, the Romance they encounter Iran’s Supreme Leader in Qom as the world teeters on the brink of nuclear confrontation and World War III, while mysterious events unfold leading Sartorius and McKinsey from their captivity in the underground nuclear facilities of Qom into a hidden neo-mythic dimension that takes them to a vast ocean and land at the center of the world, Middle Earth, Inner Shambhala, and to involvement in a mysterious Castalian “Crystal Bead Game” linked to the destiny of the human race on earth. They then embark on a quest for the Silmaril, or Missing Seed Crystal to the central island of Omphalos in the Great Central Sea in the middle of the globe, aided by Goethe, the Chinese Monkey King, Captain Nemo, the African God-Hero Ogun, and a Sufi mystic they traverse a ‘wormhole’ at the center of the earth guarded by ‘The Mothers’ and the fallen angel tribe of the Grigori (Genesis 6:1-4) which leads the way to critical meeting of the “Council of the Immortals” at the Black Hole in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy to determine the final fate of the human species. The heroes battle and overcome the treacherous opposition of Mephisto and his satanic subaltern Mundus through their Underworld and Otherworld adventures and successfully plead the cause of the continuation of the human species before the Immortals, returning with the critical Silmaril Crystal, resolving the Crystal Bead Game and thereby inspiring through the Archangel Gabriel a dream in the mind of Iran’s Supreme Leader which brings a new Revelation causing him to release the hostages and an end the crisis. China and Russia stand down from aiding Iran in seizing the Mid-East oil reserves, but in a treacherous blow the Chinese instead utilize their forward-positioned armies to attack their former ally Russia and seize Siberia with its large oil and gas reserves instead. President Barret Osama, America’s newly-elected first black President then invites Russia, Japan and South Korea to join NATO and together they succeed in expelling the Chinese from Siberia and usher in a new Eurasian and global balance of power and a New World Order.Rock Superstar Osiris meanwhile, after undertaking a narcissistic Messianic mission in the wake of the Jerusalem atomic blast is dramatically assassinated on live world-wide television on Jerusalem’s Via Dolorosa by a disillusioned follower. His wife and rock-star partner Isis then leads a spiritual movement to reconcile and unite the clashing religions and catalyze a common global spiritual Renaissance through a Global Progressive Spiritual Alliance which seeks to construct an Inter-faith Temple on the ruins of the atomic blast in Jerusalem. In counter-reaction to the cataclysmic events the world finally implements Sartorius’ crusade for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, but not before Sartorius has himself has died, Moses-like of a heart attack while helping to foil a metaconspiracy mediated by Time Travel in which a fascist agent from the 23rd Century who has time-transited back to our time to alter a benign history by causing WWIII and thus preventing the evolution of a democratic world government, the United States of Earth, which follows him through time and nabs him just in the “nick of time” to prevent Aramgeddon. The book ends with the opening ceremony of the UN Parliamentary Assembly which is attended in Sartorius’ name by his widow Eva Strong, whom Sartorius had fallen in love with and married in the course of the novel, and by their son Euphy, newborn after Sartorius’ death. They are joined in cinematic climax at the ceremony by newly chosen UN Secretary-General Clinton, President Osama and UN Parliamentary Assembly Committee Chairman Andreas Sarkozy who have just received the Nobel Peace Prize for their work in creation of the world’s first world parliamentary assembly within the United Nations, bringing together the representative voices of the peoples of the world in face-to-face assembly and dialogue for the first time in world history.

A Man Named Dave,Dave Pelzer (Goodreads Author),"More About DaveA Man Named Dave is the conclusion to a trio of autobiographical books by Dave Pelzer, who to millions of readers of A Child Called ""It"" and The Lost Boy has become an inspirational figure. A Child Called ""It"" is the gripping and harrowing account of Pelzer's abuse at the hands of his mother, beginning when he was four years old and continuing until teachers and neighbors were finally able to intervene and he was placed in foster care at age 12. The Lost Boy picks up where A Child Called ""It"" leaves off and details Pelzer's experiences in foster care and his difficulty navigating the ""normal"" world with the dark shadows of his abuse and of his mother's actual presence in his life looming over him.In this installment, Pelzer narrates his life from his enlistment in the Air Force at age 18 to the present day. While all three books show the consequences of profound cruelty with a frank immediacy and gut-wrenching, carefully chosen detail, they are -- as the subtitle of this final installment of the trilogy suggests -- ardently inspirational works. Pelzer's thematic focus is forgiveness and the ability of the human spirit to triumph over adversity. Pelzer demonstrates that it is possible to channel feelings and experiences of trauma into positive energy.Pelzer includes just enough flashback and summary material that the reader new to his work has a complete grasp of the scope of his mother's abuse and his experiences in foster care. And those fans who have read his previous work will find A Man Named Dave to be an essential, capping complement to A Child Called ""It"" and The Lost Boy.A Man Named Dave describes Pelzer's more recent experiences and affords readers access to a more mature, gradually ripening adult perspective during Pelzer's agonizing struggle to confront the demons of his past and conquer them. To read all three works in sequence is, therefore, to experience a voyage from darkness with only a glimmer of hope to full illumination.Throughout A Man Named Dave, Pelzer carries with him a touchstone memory from his childhood, on which he ruminates and to which he returns in his most acute moments of distress. The memory is from his very early childhood, when he and his father had a tender talk alone during a family outing to the Russian River. This is an immensely precious memory for Pelzer, who has an abiding love for the father who mostly stood by or was absent during the long period of his mother's abuse. This treasured fragment from the past serves as a driving force in Pelzer's adult life -- he dreams of building a house on the Russian River and ultimately, living there with his father.Sadly, this is not to be. Pelzer joins the Air Force with the intention of becoming a firefighter, which, for a time, was his father's occupation as well, and while there, he writes letter after letter to his father, who responds only once, in a mostly illegible, scrawling letter that includes no return address. Pelzer fears that his father is lost to alcoholism and vagrant wandering. When Pelzer is finally alerted to the fact that his father is near death, he rushes to be with him. Pelzer's dying father is barely able to communicate, but in spending his final days by his father's side, Pelzer is able to begin to confront his childhood and to form a positive, productive link to his traumatic past. One of his father's final actions is to pass his cherished fire department badge on to his son.The death of Pelzer's father means that he must also confront his mother, who, though she would have little to do with her husband during his decline and death, makes her son feel ostracized and uncomfortable at the funeral. The full-grown Pelzer, an outwardly successful man in an Air Force uniform, must struggle to avoid becoming a craven boy in her presence once again. The narrative is punctuated with such excruciating encounters between Pelzer and his mother. Despite the fact that his mother no longer has any physical or legal power over him, Pelzer is still dominated by her presence. The scenes provide a telling portrayal of the consequences of childhood trauma and illustrate the almost epic immensity of Pelzer's ultimately successful struggle to overcome the legacy of his mother's abuse. Essential to this struggle is that Pelzer realizes despite the welling of powerful emotions inside of him, he must do all he can to not hate his mother or wreak vengeance on her in any form. If he is to ""break the cycle"" of abuse, he must confront his childhood and its effects on his adult life. It is this triumphal will -- to come to grips with his past and somehow transmute its effects on his character into a positive view of himself and the world he inhabits -- that forces Pelzer to seek out and speak with his mother despite his instinct to run from this past and hide it from others. In his depiction of himself as a young boy, Pelzer showed how he used indomitable spirit to triumph over tyranny. In A Man Named Dave, he will inspire most readers as he makes his voyage to adulthood and a fulfilling life -- all the while struggling with the legacy of his abuse. Part of this legacy is a difficulty with intimacy and attachment. Pelzer hides much of his past from his first wife, Patsy, and is unable to tell her he loves her. His self-doubt contributes to the tumult of their relationship, essentially a mismatch cemented by the discovery that Patsy is pregnant.Ultimately, the birth of his son, Stephen, is the final key to Pelzer's reconciliation with his past. Stephen is a constant reminder to Pelzer of the preciousness of life and the imperative of breaking the chain of abuse so that Stephen will grow up knowing abundant love. In order to provide this love to Stephen, Pelzer must learn to love himself as well.In a touching moment near the book's end, Pelzer walks with his son to the very spot where, as a child, he remembers walking with his own father many years ago and sharing in the natural splendor. The cycle of abuse has been broken, and Pelzer shares his quiet triumph not only with his son but also with his readers.David S.

"Ex Ponto, Nemiri, Lirika",Ivo Andrić,"=From the Sea, Riots, LyricsAndrić’s first published works were poems and he continued to write verse intermittenly all his life, altho much of it was unpublished until his death. His 1st poems appeared in the context of the Young Bosnia movement. The writing of its members is in marked contrast to their robust active personalities. The poems Andrić published before WWI are virtually indistinguishable in tone from much of what his contemporaries were writing. Nevertheless, it's probably true to say that in his case the role of the political activist, however sincerely he played it at the time, was fundamentally unsuited to him. By contrast, however, the prevailing melancholy seemed to match his temperamental reponse to the world. These early poems point in no particular direction, beyond establishing the free verse form of virtually all of Andrić’s poetry and a tendency to a mournful self-pity which sometimes threatens his personal statements. The prose poems written during the War represent a personal conffesion & cannot be considered merely the reflection of a literary vogue. “Ex Ponto” (refers to Ovid’s account of his Black Sea exile) was published in 1918; “Unrest” in 1920, when “Ex Ponto” was already reprinted. Thereafter Andrić refused to allow them to be included in any of his collections of his works published before his death. He rejected them because they seemed to him too intimate. But, they're important since they contain ideas & themes which recur in his later works. The strong emotional colouring was toned down in Andrić’s later prose poems & verse but their form, a combination of aphoristic statements & longer reflective passages, continued to appeal to him. “Ex Ponto” & “Unrest” record his emotional reaction to the circumstances of his early life & the development of a number of themes around the central paradox of his personality & work.","['Poetry', 'Classics', 'Serbian Literature']",4.45,615

A Childhood: The Biography of a Place,"Harry Crews (Illustrations), Michael McCurdy (Illustrator)","A Childhood is the unforgettable memoir of Harry Crews' earliest years, a sharply remembered portrait of the people, locales, and circumstances that shaped him--and destined him to be a storyteller. Crews was born in the middle of the Great Depression, in a one-room sharecropper's cabin at the end of a dirt road in rural South Georgia. If Bacon County was a place of grinding poverty, poor soil, and blood feuds, it was also a deeply mystical place, where snakes talked, birds could possess a small boy by spitting in his mouth, and faith healers and conjure women kept ghosts and devils at bay.At once shocking and elegiac, heartrending and comical, A Childhood not only recalls the transforming events of Crews's youth but conveys his growing sense of self in a world ""in which survival depended on raw courage, a courage born out of desperation and sustained by a lack of alternatives.""Amid portraits of relatives and neighbors, Bacon County lore, and details of farm life, Crews tells of his father's death; his friendship with Willalee Bookatee, the son of a black hired hand; his bout with polio; his mother and stepfather's failing marriage; his near-fatal scalding at a hog-killing; and a five-month sojourn in Jacksonville, Florida. These and other memories define, with reverence and affection, Harry Crews's childhood world: ""its people and its customs and all its loveliness and all its ugliness."" Imaginative and gripping, A Childhood re-creates in detail one writer's search for past and self, a search for a time and place lost forever except in memory.","['Memoir', 'Nonfiction', 'Biography', 'Southern', 'Southern Gothic', 'Biography Memoir', 'Autobiography', 'History', 'Literature', 'Family']",4.37,1317

Half Broke Horses,Jeannette Walls,"Jeannette Walls's memoir The Glass Castle was ""nothing short of spectacular"" (Entertainment Weekly). Now, in Half Broke Horses, she brings us the story of her grandmother, told in a first-person voice that is authentic, irresistible, and triumphant. ""Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did."" So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, Jeannette Walls's no nonsense, resourceful, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. By age six, Lily was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, she left home to teach in a frontier town -- riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, to get to her job. She learned to drive a car (""I loved cars even more than I loved horses. They didn't need to be fed if they weren't working, and they didn't leave big piles of manure all over the place"") and fly a plane. And, with her husband Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona. She raised two children, one of whom is Jeannette's memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle. Lily survived tornadoes, droughts, floods, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds -- against women, Native Americans, and anyone else who didn't fit the mold. Rosemary Smith Walls always told Jeannette that she was like her grandmother, and in this true-life novel, Jeannette Walls channels that kindred spirit. Half Broke Horses is Laura Ingalls Wilder for adults, as riveting and dramatic as Isak Dinesen's Out of Africa or Beryl Markham's West with the Night.

Bill Bryson's African Diary,Bill Bryson,"In the early fall of 2002, famed travel Writer Bill Bryson journeyed to Kenya at the invitation of CARE International, the charity dedicated to working with local communities to eradicate poverty around the world. He arrived with a set of mental images of Africa gleaned from television broadcasts of low-budget Jungle Jim movies in his Iowa childhood and a single viewing of the film version of Out of Africa. (Also with some worries about tropical diseases, insects and large predators.) But the vibrant reality of Kenya and its people took over the second he deplaned in Nairobi, and this diary records Bill Bryson's impresssions of his trip with his inimitable trademark style of wry observation and curious insight. From the wrenching poverty of the Kibera slum in Nairobi to the meticulously manicured grounds of the Karen Blixen house and the human fossil riches of the National Museum, Bryson registers the striking contrasts of a postcolonial society in transition. He visits the astoundingly vast Great Rift Valley; undergoes the rigors of a teeth-rattling train journey to Mombasa and a hair-whitening flight through a vicious storm; and visits the refugee camps and the agricultural and economic projects where dedicated CARE professionals wage noble and dogged war against poverty, dislocation and corruption.","['Travel', 'Nonfiction', 'Africa', 'Memoir', 'Humor', 'Kenya', 'Biography', 'Adventure', 'History', 'Autobiography']",3.45,8670

Going Back to Zen: Where to Find Peace So You Can Live Like Mad,Janine Vance (Goodreads Author),"We live in a world that glorifies and glamorizes whoever has the most money, and whoever shines the most brightly. But is being top dog synonymous with happiness? The evidence suggests, no. If so, the richest among us would be immune to humiliation, grief, depression, and anxiousness etc.. All of these emotions are significant parts of the human condition regardless of age, economic status, religion, and ethnic background. I have found that comfort, acceptance, and humor prevails like wind beneath gilded wings. Sometimes, the higher we climb on that corporate ladder, the more we fear the potential fall. When we are on the bottom rung, we can appreciate the ground below which houses our roots. When forced to see from the ground up (or the back alley), we are led to a transformational and fulfilling life. For myself, this evolution has led me to my ethnic roots and recoup all that it provides.",[],4.96,53

Autoportret într-o oglindă spartă,Octavian Paler,"„In acest «autoportret» imi pun, mai explicit, o problema mai veche. Ce am in urma mea? O biografie? Sau un destin? Biografia mea n-are nimic spectaculos. Poate doar faptul ca am trait usor somnambulic, intre realitate si vis, sa fie interesant. Dar daca vad in urma mea, cum inclin sa vad, «un destin», ma lovesc de alte intrebari.M-am inselat, oare, crezind ca destinul este, in buna masura, o consecinta a caracterului nostru? E adevarat ca ereditatea a jucat rolul de ursitoare si ca defectele mele au facut restul? In fine, e gresita sau nu convingerea mea ca destinul nu e ocult si tenebros, ci actioneaza la vedere prin amanunte de o teribila banalitate, perfect anodine, carora nu le-am dat importanta cuvenita?

Fatelessness,"Imre Kertész, Tim Wilkinson (Translator)","At the age of 14 Georg Koves is plucked from his home in a Jewish section of Budapest and without any particular malice, placed on a train to Auschwitz. He does not understand the reason for his fate. He doesn’t particularly think of himself as Jewish. And his fellow prisoners, who decry his lack of Yiddish, keep telling him, “You are no Jew.” In the lowest circle of the Holocaust, Georg remains an outsider.The genius of Imre Kertesz’s unblinking novel lies in its refusal to mitigate the strangeness of its events, not least of which is Georg’s dogmatic insistence on making sense of what he witnesses–or pretending that what he witnesses makes sense. Haunting, evocative, and all the more horrifying for its rigorous avoidance of sentiment, Fatelessness is a masterpiece in the traditions of Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, and Tadeusz Borowski.","['Fiction', 'Historical Fiction', 'Holocaust', 'Hungary', 'Hungarian Literature', 'Nobel Prize', 'Classics', 'War', 'World War II', 'Literature']",4.07,8350

No Less Than Victory,Jeff Shaara,"No Less Than Victory is the crowning achievement in master storyteller Jeff Shaara’s soaring World War II trilogy, revealing the European war’s unforgettable and harrowing final act. After the success of the Normandy invasion, the Allied commanders are buoyantly confident that the war in Europe will be over in a matter of weeks, that Hitler and his battered army have no other option than surrender. But despite the advice of his best military minds, Hitler will hear no talk of defeat. In mid-December 1944, the Germans launch a desperate and ruthless counteroffensive in the Ardennes forest, utterly surprising the unprepared Americans who stand in their way. Through the frigid snows of the mountainous terrain, German tanks and infantry struggle to realize Hitler’s goal: divide the Allied armies and capture the vital port at Antwerp. The attack succeeds in opening up a wide gap in the American lines, and for days chaos reigns in the Allied command. Thus begins the Battle of the Bulge, the last gasp by Hitler’s forces that becomes a horrific slugging match, some of the most brutal fighting of the war. As American commanders respond to the stunning challenge, the German spear is finally blunted.Though some in the Nazi inner circle continue the fight to secure Germany’s postwar future, the Führer makes it clear that he is fighting to the end. He will spare nothing–not even German lives–to preserve his twisted vision of a “Thousand Year Reich.” But in May 1945, the German army collapses, and with Russian troops closing in, Hitler commits suicide. As the Americans sweep through the German countryside, they unexpectedly encounter the worst of Hitler’s crimes, the concentration camps, and young GIs find themselves absorbing firsthand the horrors of the Holocaust.Presenting his riveting account through the eyes of Eisenhower and Patton and the young GIs who struggle face-to-face with their enemy, and through the eyes of Germany’s old soldier, Gerd von Rundstedt, and Hitler’s golden boy, Albert Speer, Jeff Shaara carries the reader on a journey that defines the spirit of the soldier and the horror of a madman’s dreams.","['Historical Fiction', 'Fiction', 'World War II', 'War', 'Military Fiction', 'Historical', 'American History', 'Military History', 'Audiobook', 'Adult Fiction']",4.28,4465

As Mr. Watts says, “A person entranced by a book simply forgets to breathe.” Soon come the rest of the villagers, initially threatened, finally inspired to share tales of their own that bring alive the rich mythology of their past. But in a ravaged place where even children are forced to live by their wits and daily survival is the only objective, imagination can be a dangerous thing.","['Historical Fiction', 'War', 'Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Contemporary', 'Book Club', 'Historical', 'Books About Books', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction']",3.68,18153
Stirring Up Trouble,Juli Alexander (Goodreads Author),"""A seriously entertaining read."" --Livin' Life Through Books ""I had a big smile on my face the entire time I was reading it."" --Author Karen Hall ""Don't start this book late at night because you will not be able to put it down until you have finished it."" --Mermaid from Tennessee Zoe Miller is a 15-year-old witch with a talent for potions. She's working hard to find a substitute for toad slime. Since fat-free margarine has been found to be a substitute for dead man's toe, she's hopeful that she'll find one. Then there's all the so-called normal stuff. Like high school, her annoyingly selfish ""friend"" Anya, and her crush on Anya's ex-boyfriend Jake. Now, Zoe's dad is dating Jake's mom, and things are getting more and more complicated. If only Zoe could brew a potion or two and set everything straight. Zoe can't. If she brews a self-serving potion, bad things will happen to her appearance. Like a crooked nose, giant wart, green skin, rotting teeth--the whole ugly witch stereotype. Zoe's tired of fate interfering so cruelly in her life. Can you really blame her for putting her potions to not-so-good use and stirring up trouble? ****************************************Excerpt: ""Should we leave?"" I whispered to Jake to distract him. ""No,"" he said, leaning closer to me. Suddenly, he didn't seem as stressed but more like his old self. ""I think I should kiss you."" ""What? No!"" Oh my God! ""Why not?"" he asked in a low voice that sent shivers through me. I made myself look at him as I whispered, ""Because you don't want to kiss me, you just want to bother Anya. And she's my best friend."" ""Right,"" he said, backing away. ""I guess we shouldn't then."" Of course, I'd really hoped that he would say that he did want to kiss me and not only to bother Anya. ""Would it help that it would also drive our parents nuts?"" Hmmm. ""Let me think for a minute,"" I said. It would really mess with Dad's head. And that excuse would be good enough for Anya. I already had a major crush. How much worse could it get? Glancing at Anya and quickly judging how dark the theater was, I said, ""Okay.""

Now, Jeff Shaara brings this legendary father-son trilogy to its stunning conclusion in a novel that brings to life the final two years of the Civil War.As The Last Full Measure opens, Gettysburg is past and the war advances to its third brutal year. On the Union side, the gulf between the politicians in Washington and the generals in the field yawns ever wider. Never has the cumbersome Union Army so desperately needed a decisive, hard-nosed leader. It is at this critical moment that Lincoln places Ulysses S. Grant in command--and turns the tide of war.For Robert E. Lee, Gettysburg was an unspeakable disaster--compounded by the shattering loss of the fiery Stonewall Jackson two months before. Lee knows better than anyone that the South cannot survive a war of attrition. But with the total devotion of his generals--Longstreet, Hill, Stuart--and his unswerving faith in God, Lee is determined to fight to the bitter end.Here too is Joshua Chamberlain, the college professor who emerged as the Union hero of Gettysburg--and who will rise to become one of the greatest figures of the Civil War.Battle by staggering battle, Shaara dramatizes the escalating confrontation between Lee and Grant--complicated, heroic, deeply troubled men. From the costly Battle of the Wilderness to the agonizing siege of Petersburg to Lee's epoch-making surrender at Appomattox, Shaara portrays the riveting conclusion of the Civil War through the minds and hearts of the individuals who gave their last full measure.Full of human passion and the spellbinding truth of history, The Last Full Measure is the fitting capstone to a magnificent literary trilogy.From the Hardcover edition.","['Historical Fiction', 'Civil War', 'Fiction', 'War', 'Historical', 'American Civil War', 'Military Fiction', 'American History', 'Military History', 'Classics']",4.24,14700

Fabian. Die Geschichte eines Moralisten,Erich Kästner,"Erich Kästner kennen viele nur als Autor von Kinder- und Jugendbüchern. Dass er auch zeitkritische Romane geschrieben hat, wissen die wenigsten. Der Roman Fabian entstand 1931 und beschreibt den moralischen und geistigen Verfall inmitten schwieriger politischer Verhältnisse. Für Kästner gehen in dieser Zeit politischer und moralischer Verfall der Gesellschaft Hand in Hand. Fabian ist ein arbeitsloser Germanist, der durch die Großstadt Berlin zieht auf der Suche nach Arbeit, auf der Suche nach Kontakten. Wir erleben mit, wie er Menschen trifft, die ihn kaufen wollen, wie sich seine Freundin prostituiert, um Schauspielerin zu werden. Sein bester Freund begeht Selbstmord wegen einer lächerlichen Bemerkung. Ein Erfinder tritt auf, der seine Erfindungen, die Arbeitsplätze vernichtet haben, zurücknehmen will, was nicht geht. Die Stadt ist in Auflösung begriffen, die Menschen leben wie in einem Irrenhaus, einem hoffnungslosen, unbarmherzigen Labyrinth. Fabian ist ein Außenseiter, ein Moralist, seine Waffe ist die Beobachtung, die Distanz, die durch sarkastische Bemerkungen hergestellt wird. Sein Anspruch besteht darin, zuzusehen, ""ob die Welt Talent zur Anständigkeit hat"". Kästner stellt dem Moralisten Fabian, ein Mensch übrigens, der moralisch integer ist, ohne dass ihm dies als Lebensentwurf bewusst ist oder er den Zeigefinger erhebt, menschliche Korrumpierbarkeit, Gewissenlosigkeit und Anpassung entgegen. So finden sich im Buch eine ganze Reihe von wirklich gelungenen satirischen Spitzen, wie z.B. eine Tombola, bei der Nahrungsmittel verlost werden oder eine Pöbelei von Menschen als Abendunterhaltung. Kästners Beschreibungen der Menschen sind bissig und schonungslos. Charakteristisch für die Moral der Menschen ist das Verhalten des Redakteurs Müntzer, der etwas unterstützt, an das er nicht glaubt und dessen Falschheit er durchschaut. Von Müntzer heißt es, dass er sein Gewissen chloroformiert hat. Fabian ist ein Roman mit vielen wirklich gelungenen zeitkritischen Beobachtungen, die auch heute nichts von ihrer Aktualität verloren haben. Schließlich steht im Zentrum von Kästners Gesellschaftskritik die menschliche Schwäche, die Lethargie, genau um die Falschheit der Verhältnisse zu wissen, aber nichts dagegen zu tun -- und diese Kritik hat auch heute nichts von seiner Berechtigung verloren. --Christoph Steven","['Fiction', 'German Literature', 'Classics', 'Germany', 'Literature', 'Novels', '20th Century', 'School', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literary Fiction']",4.13,3735
Metro 2033,Dmitry Glukhovsky (Goodreads Author),"The year is 2033. The world has been reduced to rubble. Humanity is nearly extinct. The half-destroyed cities have become uninhabitable through radiation. Beyond their boundaries, they say, lie endless burned-out deserts and the remains of splintered forests. Survivors still remember the past greatness of humankind. But the last remains of civilisation have already become a distant memory, the stuff of myth and legend. More than 20 years have passed since the last plane took off from the earth. Rusted railways lead into emptiness. The ether is void and the airwaves echo to a soulless howling where previously the frequencies were full of news from Tokyo, New York, Buenos Aires.

A few score thousand survivors live on, not knowing whether they are the only ones left on earth. They live in the Moscow Metro - the biggest air-raid shelter ever built. It is humanity's last refuge. Stations have become mini-statelets, their people uniting around ideas, religions, water-filters - or the simple need to repulse an enemy incursion. It is a world without a tomorrow, with no room for dreams, plans, hopes. Feelings have given way to instinct - the most important of which is survival. Survival at any price. VDNKh is the northernmost inhabited station on its line. It was one of the Metro's best stations and still remains secure. But now a new and terrible threat has appeared. Artyom, a young man living in VDNKh, is given the task of penetrating to the heart of the Metro, to the legendary Polis, to alert everyone to the awful danger and to get help. He holds the future of his native station in his hands, the whole Metro - and maybe the whole of humanity.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Horror', 'Post Apocalyptic', 'Dystopia', 'Fantasy', 'Russia', 'Apocalyptic', 'Russian Literature', 'Audiobook']",4.0,41414

Geschwister Tanner : Roman,Robert Walser,"""Mit leichtem Gepäck und offenen, unbestechlichen Augen wandert dieser moderne Taugenichts durch die Welt und am Ende wird nichts aus ihm als das Vergnügen des Lesers."" Franz KafkaRobert Walser gehört zu den Autoren der klassischen Moderne. 'Geschwister Tanner' ist sein erster und zugleich sein unbeschwertester Roman. Wie sein Verfasser ist der Held des Buches, Simon Tanner, besessen von einem unbändigen Freiheitsdrang und betrachtet die Welt und die Menschen ganz unbefangen, nicht mit einem 'verbildeten, verstopften Kopf'. Das bringt ihn in die kuriosesten Konflikte mit der Welt der Konventionen, mit den Angepaßten, den von Karriere und Konkurrenz Kompromittierten. Durch seine Arglosigkeit provoziert er sie und beschämt sie durch das, was sie verloren haben: Phantasie, Humor, gesunden Menschenverstand und materielle Unbestechlichkeit.Die 'Geschwister Tanner' sind ein Märchen, und sie sind für mich das erstaunlichste Märchen, das je geschrieben wurde, weil es kein anderes gibt, das so nahe an der Realität spielt.'

This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style—thorough, yet riveting—famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century—from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.","['Nonfiction', 'History', 'Science', 'Philosophy', 'Audiobook', 'Anthropology', 'Sociology', 'Technology', 'Politics', 'Psychology']",4.24,147289

The Illumination,Kevin Brockmeier,"From best-selling and award-winning author Kevin Brockmeier: a new novel of stunning artistry and imagination about the wounds we bear and the light that radiates from us all.What if our pain was the most beautiful thing about us? In the aftermath of a fatal car accident, a private journal of love notes written by a husband to his wife passes into the keeping of a hospital patient, and from there through the hands of five other suffering people, touching each of them uniquely.

The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically,Peter Singer (Goodreads Author),"From the ethicist the New Yorker calls “the most influential living philosopher,” a new way of thinking about living ethically""Singer’s argument is powerful, provocative and, I think, basically right. The world would be a better place if we were as tough-minded in how we donate money as in how we make it.""—Nicholas Kristof, New York Times ""Bold, fresh, inspired, reasoned, optimistic.""—Walter M. Bortz II, MD, Huffington Post Blog Peter Singer’s books and ideas have been disturbing our complacency ever since the appearance of Animal Liberation. Now he directs our attention to a new movement in which his own ideas have played a crucial role: effective altruism. Effective altruism is built upon the simple but profound idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the ""most good you can do."" Such a life requires an unsentimental view of charitable giving: to be a worthy recipient of our support, an organization must be able to demonstrate that it will do more good with our money or our time than other options open to us. Singer introduces us to an array of remarkable people who are restructuring their lives in accordance with these ideas, and shows how living altruistically often leads to greater personal fulfillment than living for oneself.The Most Good You Can Do develops the challenges Singer has made, in the New York Times and Washington Post, to those who donate to the arts, and to charities focused on helping our fellow citizens, rather than those for whom we can do the most good. Effective altruists are extending our knowledge of the possibilities of living less selfishly, and of allowing reason, rather than emotion, to determine how we live. The Most Good You Can Do offers new hope for our ability to tackle the world’s most pressing problems.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Economics', 'Self Help', 'Personal Development', 'Society', 'Social Justice', 'International Development', 'Politics']",3.85,2302

"Corrupting the Image: Angels, Aliens, and the Antichrist Revealed",Douglas Hamp,"Something ominous is coming upon the world: it is Satan's final effort in the battle to destroy the image that man was created in, which has been raging since the beginning of time. If Satan can destroy the image, then he can avert his own destruction. The prophecy of Genesis 3:15 states the serpent will one day mix his seed with humanity as a counterfeit of the Messiah. Jesus told us that the last days will be like the days of Noah when fallen angels mixed their seed with humanity. In the Book of Daniel we read that ""they"" will again mingle with the seed of men. How so? Satan will use man's desire to be his own god to deceive him into believing the ultimate lie - that his fallen messengers are both the creators and saviors of man. He will not do this openly but will deceive mankind through demons which are masquerading as ""aliens"" who are spreading the message that the inhabitants of the earth can evolve to be like them and obtain transcendent powers. Finally, the seed of the Serpent will come; he will be a man who will be greater than his fellows, who will understand sinister schemes and shall rise up and become the Antichrist.

"The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness","Epictetus, Sharon Lebell (Retold by)","Epictetus was born into slavery about 55 C.E. in the eastern outreaches of the Roman Empire. Sold as a child and crippled from the beatings of his master, Epictetus was eventually freed, rising from his humble roots to establish an influential school of Stoic philosophy. Stressing that human beings cannot control life, only how they respond to it, Epictetus dedicated his life to outlining the simple way to happiness, fulfillment, and tranquility. By putting into practice the ninety-three witty, wise, and razor-sharp instructions that make up The Art of Living, readers learn to successfully meet the challenges of everyday life and face life's inevitable losses and disappointments with grace. Epictetus's teachings rank among the greatest wisdom texts of human civilization. Sharon Lebell presents this esteemed philosopher's invaluable insights for the first time in a splendidly down-to-earth rendition. The result is the West's first and best primer for living the best possible life -- as helpful in the twenty-first century as it was in the first.","['Philosophy', 'Nonfiction', 'Classics', 'Self Help', 'Psychology', 'Spirituality', 'History', 'Personal Development', 'Ancient', 'Ancient History']",4.24,14555

Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age,"Paul Graham, Allen Noren (Editor), Matt Hutchinson (Editor)","“The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you’re willing to risk the consequences.” —from Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul GrahamWe are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls “an intellectual Wild West.”The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.","['Nonfiction', 'Programming', 'Business', 'Technology', 'Computer Science', 'Computers', 'Philosophy', 'Essays', 'Science', 'Software']",4.06,8090

The Golden Fleece,Robert Graves,"Reissued by Creative Age Press in 1945 as Hercules, My Shipmate, a novel about the voyage of the Argo. Written with ideas on The White Goddess as a cultural/anthropological backdrop to the ancient Greek tale. What the Golden Fleece really was—a cloak tossed to earth by a drunken Zeus, a sheepskin book of alchemic secrets or the gilded epidermis of a young human sacrifice named Mr. Ram—nobody knows. But Graves is quite sure that, whatever the Golden Fleece was, the voyage of Jason & his Argonauts really happened. His story shows the legendary cruise as one of the bawdiest, bloodiest, most boisterous expeditions of all time. In I, Claudius & its Claudius the God sequel, Graves brought the teeming life of Claudian Rome so vividly alive that they became bestsellers. In the not-so-successful Wife to Mr. Milton, his blend of imagination & scholarship projected his readers into 17th-Century England & the bedchamber temper tantrums of the blind poet-politician. With Hercules & shipmates, Graves becomes an ancient Greek, moving among demigods & goddesses, myths & monsters with an easy familiarity & a wealth of erudite detail. Both sometimes seem too much of a good thing. Atomic-age readers, ill-attuned to the leisurely, formal talk of myth-age Greeks, may find themselves skipping some of the longer speeches. Most of the Argo's 50-oar crew were princes, each with a special talent & gift of the gods. The only woman aboard was a princess: Atalanta of Calydon, a virgin huntress who could outrun any man in Greece. Argus, who built the Argo, was the world's finest shipwright. Castor & Pollux, sons of Leda & Zeus-as-swan, were champion prizefighters. Nauplius, Poseidon's son, was an unrivaled navigator. Orpheus could make sticks & stones dance to his lyre. Hercules of Tiryns was the world's strongest man. He would've captained the Argonauts were it not that in moments of insanity he murdered friend & foe alike. Captaincy devolved on Jason of lolcos—a man nobody liked or trusted, but who had a power denied to all the others: women instantly fell in love with him. Even surly Hercules agreed it a quality worth all the rest. Backed by divine blessings & equinoctal winds, the Argonauts set sail. On the Island of Lemnos, peopled solely by women, they generously stopped off to help out with spring sowing. Nine months later, 200 children were born, of whom no less than 60 were said to be the spitting image of Hercules. On Samothrace, they were initiated into the sacred mysteries. The Goddess of All Being mated with the Serpent Priapus to be delivered of a bull. Then the sacred nymphs leapt on them & scratched & bit until even Hercules passed out. Thereafter, the Argonauts glowed with ""a faint nimbus of light."" The Argonauts boldly pushed on thru the dread Hellespont & entered the Black Sea. To their dismay, Hercules deserted, summoned home to perform another of his mighty labors. ""Holy Serpents!"" he growled. ""Tell me what this time?"" The job—cleaning the Augean Stables—didn't take long. He stayed around afterwards with the Lydian high priestess—who in due time bore male triplets. In gratitude, she taught him to spin, tying up his hair in blue braids. He was crazy about it, admitting confidentially he'd always wanted to be a woman. The Argonauts went on without Hercules. Reaching Colchis, Aphrodite won the Fleece for them. She made her son Eros wait behind a pillar with his bow until handsome Jason strode into the King of Colchis' palace. Eros shot Medea thru the heart, & the smitten princess helped to get the Fleece from her father's temple. Mythology's most famous voyage had reached its goal, but Graves takes 150 more pages to wind things up.","['Mythology', 'Historical Fiction', 'Classics', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Greece', 'Historical', 'Literature', 'Adventure', 'Ancient History']",4.04,815
The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty,Carolyn G.

Taking her own life at the age of seventy, she reasoned, would give closure to a life well lived. But on the advent of her seventieth birthday she realized that the past ten years, the years of her sixties, had been filled with unexpected pleasures.

I daily choose life the more earnestly because it is a choice.""

Lob der Disziplin. Eine Streitschrift,Bernhard Bueb,"Disziplin, so hat die Erfahrung den langjährigen Schulleiter des Internats Salem, Bernhard Bueb, gelehrt, ist das Tor zum Glück. Sie, so seine These, bildet das Rückgrat einer jeden guten, das heißt: gelingenden Erziehung. Erst durch sie und mit ihr der Fähigkeit, Autorität (und Autoritäten) anzuerkennen, auf die unmittelbare Befriedigung eines jeden Bedürfnisses zu verzichten und Verantwortung zu übernehmen, werden junge Menschen in die Lage versetzt, ein tatsächlich selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen -- was ja unbestritten eines der vorrangigen Ziele von Erziehung darstellt. Seiner Streitschrift, die dem überkommenen Laisser-faire-Leitbild der 68-erPädagogen das Scheitern attestiert, hat der Autor einen Fontane-Vers vorangestellt, der den Kern seines Erziehungskonzepts auf den Punkt bringt: Freiheit freilich. Aber zum Schlimmen. / Führt der Masse sich selbst Bestimmen. / Und das Klügste, das Beste, Bequemste / Das auch freien Seelen weitaus Genehmste / Heißt doch schließlich, ich hab's nicht Hehl: / Festes Gesetz und fester Befehl! Manches Elternohr wird bei solchen Worten erröten. Und dies aus guten Gründen. Das weiß natürlich auch Bernhard Bueb, der auch um die Ursache für solcherlei Unbehagen nur zu genau weiß: Zutiefst erschüttert wurde die pädagogische Kultur in Deutschland durch den Nationalsozialismus, der im Anschluss an den Kadavergehorsam der kaiserlichen Kadettenanstalten Begriffe wie Disziplin und Autorität in der pädagogischen Praxis vollends pervertierte. Die 68-er-Pädagogik war der Pendelschlag in die Richtung des anderen Extrems, der scheinbar völligen Beliebigkeit. Gegen diese Beliebigkeit zieht Bueb bei aller Irritation, die seine provokant klingenden Thesen bei vielen Lesern hervorrufen wird, mit guten Gründen zu Felde. Wir wünschen dem Autor jedenfalls, dass sein Lob der Disziplin eine heftige Debatte auslöst. Schließlich ist das der Sinn einer jeden Streitschrift. Aus unserer Sicht jedenfalls: Unbedingt lesenswert! -- Hasso Greb",[],3.38,74

The Kitab-i-Aqdas: The Most Holy Book,Bahá'u'lláh,"In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith, included as one of the goals of his Ten Year Plan the preparation of a Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitab-i-Aqdas as an essential prelude to its translation. He himself worked on the codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was released in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation of the passages from the Kitab-i-Aqdas which had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The Synopsis and Codification covered the text of both the Kitab-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of Justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an English translation of the complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986-1992. Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other languages. It has been recognized that the Kitab-i-Aqdas, being Sacred Scripture, should be presented in a form which can be read with ease and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader in following the flow of the text and its changing themes, paragraph divisions have been added—such divisions not being common in works of Arabic literature—and these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing, as well as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the work will be published.Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of Baha’u’llah which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the first time.About the Author","['Religion', 'Baha I', 'Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Scripture']",4.42,282

The class has been offered five times over 10 years, and all but one student finished the marathon. That is approximately 200 students -- all first time marathoners and many with absolutely no running background. This book follows the same 16-week, four-day-a-week workout plan. What makes the success rate of this program so much higher than any other? The special emphasis on the psychological aspects of endurance activities. You don't have to love to run -- you don't even have to like it -- but you have to realize that you are capable of more than you have ever thought possible. One participant in the program explained it like this: ""I'm doing this for me -- not for others or the time clock. I just feel better when I run, plus it helps me to cope with things in general. The skills we've learned in this class don't apply just to marathoning -- they apply to life Just like you never know what the next step in a marathon will bring, so too, you never know what will happen next in life. But if you don't keep going, you're never going to find out. By staying relaxed, centered, and positive you handle just about anything that comes your way."" This is marathon running for real people, people with jobs and families and obligations outside of running. ""The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer"" has proven successful for men and women of all ages. Now let it work for you.","['Nonfiction', 'Sports', 'Health', 'Fitness', 'Self Help', 'Reference', 'Martial Arts']",4.16,1497

1984,George Orwell,"Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life—the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language—and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Dystopia', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Politics', 'School', 'Fantasy', 'Adult']",4.19,3140442
1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,Charles C. Mann,"In this groundbreaking work of science, history, and archaeology, Charles C. Mann radically alters our understanding of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus in 1492.Contrary to what so many Americans learn in school, the pre-Columbian Indians were not sparsely settled in a pristine wilderness; rather, there were huge numbers of Indians who actively molded and influenced the land around them. The astonishing Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had running water and immaculately clean streets, and was larger than any contemporary European city. Mexican cultures created corn in a specialized breeding process that it has been called man’s first feat of genetic engineering. Indeed, Indians were not living lightly on the land but were landscaping and manipulating their world in ways that we are only now beginning to understand. Challenging and surprising, this a transformative new look at a rich and fascinating world we only thought we knew.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'American History', 'Anthropology', 'Science', 'Historical', 'World History', 'Audiobook', 'Archaeology', 'American']",4.02,66314

2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl,Daniel Pinchbeck,"Read Daniel Pinchbeck's posts on the Penguin BlogCross James Merrill, H. P. Lovecraft, and Carlos Castaneda -each imbued with a twenty-first-century aptitude for quantum theory and existential psychology-and you get the voice of Daniel Pinchbeck. And yet, nothing quite prepares us for the lucidity, rationale, and informed audacity of this seeker, skeptic, and cartographer of hidden realms. Throughout the 1990s, Pinchbeck had been a member of New York's literary select. He wrote for publications such as ""The New York Times Magazine,"" ""Esquire,"" and ""Harper's Bazaar."" His first book, ""Breaking Open the Head,"" was heralded as the most significant on psychedelic experimentation since the work of Terence McKenna. But slowly something happened: Rather than writing from a journalistic remove, Pinchbeck-his literary powers at their peak-began to participate in the shamanic and metaphysical belief systems he was encountering. As his psyche and body opened to new experience, disparate threads and occurrences made sense like never before: Humanity, every sign pointed, is precariously balanced between greater self-potential and environmental disaster. The Mayan calendar's ""end date"" of 2012 seems to define our present age: It heralds the end of one way of existence and the return of another, in which the serpent god Quetzalcoatl reigns anew, bringing with him an unimaginably ancient-yet, to us, wholly new-way of living. A result not just of study but also of participation, ""2012"" tells the tale of a single man in whose trials we ultimately recognize our own hopes and anxieties about modern life.","['Nonfiction', 'Spirituality', 'Philosophy', 'Religion', 'History', 'Occult', 'Cultural', 'Metaphysics', 'Reference', 'New Age']",3.42,1703

Author Nwaocha Ogechukwu has written an easy to read, enlightening and academically sound book regarding the symbolism and meaning of the cross in relation to religion. Ogechukwu gives historical accounts of Christianity's cover up of what the cross truly is: a satanic symbol. ""For centuries after Christ, the church and other religions that use cruciform symbols have misrepresented the physical nature of Christ's death with a satanic symbol (cross), and a pagan idol (corpus). This secret has been concealed by the church for centuries after Christ."" Ogechukwu's research leads to a stunning conclusion as it explores to understand the real nature of Christ's death, religion's role in the symbolism, and to release humankind from the ""painful knowledge bondage"" of cruciform propaganda. Nwaocha Ogechukwu is a graduate of medical science, member of the Royal Institute of Philosophy, and a researcher in philosophy, religion, history, and psychology. Nominated as ""One of the Great Minds of the 21st Century,"" by the American Biographical Institute, Mr. Ogechukwu lives in Nigeria. The Secret Behind the Cross and Crucifix is his second novel.

A Widow for One Year,John Irving (Goodreads Author),"“One night when she was four and sleeping in the bottom bunk of her bunk bed, Ruth Cole woke to the sound of lovemaking—it was coming from her parents’ bedroom.”This sentence opens John Irving’s ninth novel, A Widow for One Year, a story of a family marked by tragedy. Ruth Cole is a complex, often self-contradictory character—a “difficult” woman. By no means is she conventionally “nice,” but she will never be forgotten.Ruth’s story is told in three parts, each focusing on a critical time in her life. When we first meet her—on Long Island, in the summer of 1958—Ruth is only four.The second window into Ruth’s life opens on the fall of 1990, when she is an unmarried woman whose personal life is not nearly as successful as her literary career. She distrusts her judgment in men, for good reason.A Widow for One Year closes in the autumn of 1995, when Ruth Cole is a forty-one-year-old widow and mother. She’s about to fall in love for the first time.Richly comic, as well as deeply disturbing, A Widow for One Year is a multilayered love story of astonishing emotional force. Both ribald and erotic, it is also a brilliant novel about the passage of time and the relentlessness of grief.Source: john-irving.com","['Fiction', 'Contemporary', 'Novels', 'Literature', 'Literary Fiction', 'American', 'Adult', 'Adult Fiction', 'Romance', 'Drama']",3.76,57530

Screwjack,Hunter S. Thompson,"Hunter S. Thompson's legions of fans have waited a decade for this book. They will not be disappointed. His notorious Screwjack is as salacious, unsettling, and brutally lyrical as it has been rumored to be since the private printing in 1991 of three hundred fine collectors' copies and twenty-six leather-bound presentation copies. Only the first of the three pieces included here—""Mescalito,"" published in Thompson's 1990 collection Songs of the Doomed—has been available to the public, making the trade edition of Screwjack a major publishing event. ""We live in a jungle of pending disasters,"" Thompson warns in ""Mescalito,"" a chronicle of his first mescaline experience and what it sparked in him while he was alone in an L.A. hotel room in February 1969—including a bout of paranoia that would have made most people just scream no, once and for all. But for Thompson, along with the downside came a burst of creativity too powerful to ignore. The result is a poetic, perceptive, and wildly funny stream-of-consciousness take on 1969 America as only Hunter S. Thompson could see it. Screwjack just gets weirder with its second offering, ""Death of a Poet."" As Thompson describes this trailer-park confrontation with the dark side of a deservingly doomed friend: ""Whoops, I thought. Welcome to the night train."" The heart of the collection lies in its final, title piece, an unnaturally poignant love story. What makes the romantic tale ""Screwjack"" so touching, for all its queerness, is the aching melancholy in its depiction of the modern man's burden: that ""we are doomed. Mama has gone off to Real Estate School...and after that maybe even to Law School. We will never see her again."" Ostensibly written by Raoul Duke, ""Screwjack"" begins with an editor's note explaining of Thompson's alter ego that ""the first few lines contain no warning of the madness and fear and lust that came more and more to plague him and dominate his life...."" ""I am guilty, Lord,"" Thompson writes, ""but I am also a lover—and I am one of your best people, as you know; and yea tho I have walked in many strange shadows and acted crazy from time to time and even drooled on many High Priests, I have not been an embarrassment to you...."" Nor has Hunter S. Thompson been to American literature. Quite the contrary: What the legendary Gonzo journalist proves with Screwjack is just how brilliant a prose stylist he really is, amid all the hilarity. As Thompson puts it in his introduction, the three stories here ""build like Bolero to a faster & wilder climax that will drag the reader relentlessly up a hill, & then drop him off a cliff....That is the Desired Effect.""","['Fiction', 'Short Stories', 'American', 'Humor', 'Classics', 'Literature', 'Novels', 'Short Story Collection', 'Collections', 'Journalism']",3.58,3777
The Soul of an Octopus: A Surprising Exploration into the Wonder of Consciousness,Sy Montgomery,"In pursuit of the wild, solitary, predatory octopus, popular naturalist Sy Montgomery has practiced true immersion journalism. From New England aquarium tanks to the reefs of French Polynesia and the Gulf of Mexico, she has befriended octopuses with strikingly different personalities—gentle Athena, assertive Octavia, curious Kali, and joyful Karma. Each creature shows her cleverness in myriad ways: escaping enclosures like an orangutan; jetting water to bounce balls; and endlessly tricking companions with multiple “sleights of hand” to get food.Scientists have only recently accepted the intelligence of dogs, birds, and chimpanzees but now are watching octopuses solve problems and are trying to decipher the meaning of the animal’s color-changing techniques. With her “joyful passion for these intelligent and fascinating creatures” (Library Journal Editors’ Spring Pick), Montgomery chronicles the growing appreciation of this mollusk as she tells a unique love story. By turns funny, entertaining, touching, and profound, The Soul of an Octopus reveals what octopuses can teach us about the meeting of two very different minds.","['Nonfiction', 'Science', 'Animals', 'Nature', 'Audiobook', 'Memoir', 'Biology', 'Psychology', 'Adult', 'Natural History']",3.87,26448

No embalo das ondas não pensava na sua agenda totalmente preenchida, nas inúmeras solicitações que tinha enquanto mulher de um sucedido empresário da comunicação social e directora de uma recente aquisição do marido, o diário ´O Popular´. Esquecimento e desafio, era isso que procurava em cada ida ao Guincho. Mas a beleza pura e agreste daquela praia viria a evocar-lhe, um dia, bem mais do que isso, e ao contemplá-la seria invadida por uma outra beleza que se misturava com aquela, mas que tinha tonalidades incrivelmente profundas e ricas. Conheceria Miguel ali e seria ali que iria sentir a força e o espírito de um amor intenso, corajoso e rebelde, um amor que viria a mudar para sempre a tragectória da sua vida. Mas, por enquanto, Cristina concentrava-se apenas nos tubos azuis e brancos das ondas e não sonhava ainda que viria a apaixonar-se por um dos jornalistas mais creditados d´´O Popular´. Primeiro romance de Tiago Rebelo, Para ti Uma Vida Nova reveste-se de um inequívoco interesse literário tanto pela qualidade narrativa quanto pela construção do próprio enredo, bem estruturado e surpreendente.",['Romance'],2.96,123

But beneath its sentimental surface, A Christmas Carol offers another of Dickens’s sharply critical portraits of a brutal society, and an inspiring celebration of the possibility of spiritual, psychological, and social change.This new volume collects Dickens’s three most renowned “Christmas Books,” including The Chimes, a New Year’s tale, and The Cricket on the Hearth, whose eponymous creature remains silent during sorrow and chirps amid happiness.Katharine Kroeber Wiley, the daughter of a scholar and a sculptor, has a degree in English Literature from Occidental College. Her work has appeared in Boundary Two and the recent book, Lore of the Dolphin. She is currently working on a book on Victorian Christmas writings.","['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Christmas', 'Literature', 'Short Stories', 'Fantasy', 'Classic Literature', 'Historical Fiction', 'Victorian', 'Holiday']",4.13,56144
